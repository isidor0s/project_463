Diabetes care is complex and requires multifactorial risk reduction strategies beyond glycemic control. A large body of evidence exists that supports a range of interventions to improve diabetes outcomes.</p><p>These standards of care are intended to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested individuals with the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care. Although individual preferences, comorbidities, and other patient factors may require modification of goals, targets that are desirable for most patients with diabetes are provided. Specifically titled sections of the standards address children with diabetes, pregnant women, and people with prediabetes. These standards are not intended to preclude clinical judgment or more extensive evaluation and management of the patient by other specialists as needed. For more detailed information about management of diabetes, refer to references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>The recommendations included are screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic actions that are known or believed to favorably affect health outcomes of patients with diabetes. A large number of these interventions have been shown to be cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A grading system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), developed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and modeled after existing methods, was utilized to clarify and codify the evidence that forms the basis for the recommendations. The level of evidence that supports each recommendation is listed after each recommendation using the letters A, B, C, or E.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Level of evidence</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clear evidence from well-conducted, generalizable RCTs that are adequately powered, including:<break/><break/>&#x02022; Evidence from a well-conducted multicenter trial<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from a meta-analysis that incorporated quality ratings in the analysis<break/>Compelling nonexperimental evidence, i.e., &#x0201c;all or none&#x0201d; rule <break/>developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford<break/>Supportive evidence from well-conducted RCTs that are adequately powered, including:<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from a well-conducted trial at one or more institutions<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from a meta-analysis that incorporated quality ratings in the analysis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Supportive evidence from well-conducted cohort studies<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from a well-conducted prospective cohort study or registry<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from a well-conducted meta-analysis of cohort studies<break/>Supportive evidence from a well-conducted case-control study</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Supportive evidence from poorly controlled or uncontrolled studies<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from randomized clinical trials with one or more major or three or more minor methodological flaws that could invalidate the results<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from observational studies with high potential for bias (such as case series with comparison with historical controls)<break/>&#x02022; Evidence from case series or case reports<break/>Conflicting evidence with the weight of evidence supporting the recommendation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">E</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expert consensus or clinical experience</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>These standards of care are revised annually by the ADA&#x02019;s multidisciplinary Professional Practice Committee, incorporating new evidence.

CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS</title><sec id="s2"><title>A. Classification</title><p>The classification of diabetes includes four clinical classes:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Type 1 diabetes (results from &#x003b2;-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Type 2 diabetes (results from a progressive insulin secretory defect on the background of insulin resistance)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Other specific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., genetic defects in &#x003b2;-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis), and drug- or chemical-induced (such as in the treatment of HIV/AIDS or after organ transplantation)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy that is not clearly overt diabetes)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Some patients cannot be clearly classified as type 1 or type 2 diabetic. Clinical presentation and disease progression vary considerably in both types of diabetes. Occasionally, patients who otherwise have type 2 diabetes may present with ketoacidosis. Similarly, patients with type 1 diabetes may have a late onset and slow (but relentless) progression of disease despite having features of autoimmune disease. Such difficulties in diagnosis may occur in children, adolescents, and adults. The true diagnosis may become more obvious over time.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>B. Diagnosis of diabetes</title><p>For decades, the diagnosis of diabetes was based on plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or the 2-h value in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>In 2009, an International Expert Committee that included representatives of the ADA, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommended the use of the A1C test to diagnose diabetes, with a threshold of &#x02265;6.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and the ADA adopted this criterion in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The diagnostic test should be performed using a method that is certified by the NGSP and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. Although point-of-care (POC) A1C assays may be NGSP certified, proficiency testing is not mandated for performing the test, so use of these assays for diagnostic purposes could be problematic.</p><p>Epidemiological datasets show a similar relationship for A1C to the risk of retinopathy as has been shown for the corresponding FPG and 2-h PG thresholds. The A1C has several advantages to the FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (since fasting is not required), evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability, and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness. These advantages must be balanced by greater cost, the limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and the incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals. In addition, HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels may vary with patients&#x02019; race/ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Some have posited that glycation rates differ by race (with, for example, African Americans having higher rates of glycation), but this is controversial. A recent epidemiological study found that, when matched for FPG, African Americans (with and without diabetes) indeed had higher A1C than whites, but also had higher levels of fructosamine and glycated albumin and lower levels of 1,5 anhydroglucitol, suggesting that their glycemic burden (particularly postprandially) may be higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Epidemiological studies forming the framework for recommending use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes have all been in adult populations. Whether the cut point would be the same to diagnose children or adolescents with type 2 diabetes is an area of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). A1C inaccurately reflects glycemia with certain anemias and hemoglobinopathies. For patients with an abnormal hemoglobin but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ngsp.org/interf.asp">www.ngsp.org/interf.asp</ext-link>). For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as pregnancy, recent blood loss or transfusion, or some anemias, the diagnosis of diabetes must employ glucose criteria exclusively.</p><p>The established glucose criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes (FPG and 2-h PG) remain valid as well (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Just as there is less than 100% concordance between the FPG and 2-h PG tests, there is no perfect concordance between A1C and either glucose-based test. Analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data indicate that, assuming universal screening of the undiagnosed, the A1C cut point of &#x02265;6.5% identifies one-third fewer cases of undiagnosed diabetes than a fasting glucose cut point of &#x02265;126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and numerous studies have confirmed that at these cut points the 2-h OGTT value diagnoses more screened people with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, in practice, a large portion of the diabetic population remains unaware of its condition. Thus, the lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point may well be offset by the test&#x02019;s greater practicality, and wider application of a more convenient test (A1C) may actually increase the number of diagnoses made.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S11tbl2"/></table-wrap><p>As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with a hyperglycemic crisis or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose &#x02265;200 mg/dL. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, if two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is also confirmed.</p><p>On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results &#x02265;6.5%) but not the FPG (&#x0003c;126 mg/dL or 7.0 mmol/L), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes.</p><p>Since there is preanalytical and analytical variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis. The health care professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3&#x02013;6 months.</p><p>The current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>C. Categories of increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes)</title><p>In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. These persons were defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG levels 100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L] to 125 mg/dL [6.9 mmol/L]) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-h values in the OGTT of 140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L] to 199 mg/dL [11.0 mmol/L]). It should be noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) and a number of other diabetes organizations define the cutoff for IFG at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L).</p><p>Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.</p><p>As is the case with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8&#x02013;12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%. An A1C range of 6.0&#x02013;6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25 to 50% and relative risk (RR) 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In a community-based study of black and white adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than was fasting glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with diabetes risk similar to that in the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7&#x02013;6.4% as identifying individuals with prediabetes. As is the case for individuals found to have IFG and IGT, individuals with an A1C of 5.7&#x02013;6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes as well as CVD and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see Section IV). As with glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so that as A1C rises, the risk of diabetes rises disproportionately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Accordingly, interventions should be most intensive and follow-up particularly vigilant for those with A1Cs above 6.0%, who should be considered to be at very high risk.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> summarizes the categories of prediabetes.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Categories of increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes)*</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S11tbl3"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>II.

However, for diabetes, the same tests would be used for &#x0201c;screening&#x0201d; as for diagnosis. Diabetes may be identified anywhere along a spectrum of clinical scenarios ranging from a seemingly low-risk individual who happens to have glucose testing, to a higher-risk individual whom the provider tests because of high suspicion of diabetes, to the symptomatic patient. The discussion herein is primarily framed as testing for diabetes in those without symptoms. The same assays used for testing for diabetes will also detect individuals with prediabetes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9"><title>A. Testing for type 2 diabetes and risk of future diabetes in adults</title><p>Prediabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions in which early detection is appropriate. Both conditions are common, increasing in prevalence, and impose significant public health burdens. There is a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made. Relatively simple tests are available to detect preclinical disease. Additionally, the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, and effective interventions exist to prevent progression of prediabetes to diabetes (see Section IV) and to reduce risk of complications of diabetes (see Section VI).</p><p>Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear, and approximately one-fourth of all people with diabetes in the U.S. may be undiagnosed. The effectiveness of early identification of prediabetes and diabetes through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been proven definitively, and rigorous trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur. In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Europe, general practice patients between the ages of 40&#x02013;69 years were screened for diabetes and then randomly assigned by practice to routine care of diabetes or intensive treatment of multiple risk factors. After 5.3 years of follow-up, CVD risk factors were modestly but significantly more improved with intensive treatment. Incidence of first CVD event and mortality rates were not significantly different between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This study would seem to add support for early treatment of screen-detected diabetes, as risk factor control was excellent even in the routine treatment arm and both groups had lower event rates than predicted. The absence of a control unscreened arm limits the ability to definitely prove that screening impacts outcomes. Mathematical modeling studies suggest that screening independent of risk factors beginning at age 30 years or age 45 years is highly cost-effective (&#x0003c;$11,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Recommendations for testing for diabetes in asymptomatic, undiagnosed adults are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. Testing should be considered in adults of any age with BMI &#x02265;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and one or more of the known risk factors for diabetes. In addition to the listed risk factors, certain medications, such as glucocorticoids and antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), are known to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. There is compelling evidence that lower BMI cut points suggest diabetes risk in some racial and ethnic groups. In a large multiethnic cohort study, for an equivalent incidence rate of diabetes conferred by a BMI of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in whites, the BMI cutoff value was 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in South Asians, 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Chinese, and 26 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Disparities in screening rates, not explainable by insurance status, are highlighted by evidence that despite much higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, non-Caucasians in an insured population are no more likely than Caucasians to be screened for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Because age is a major risk factor for diabetes, testing of those without other risk factors should begin no later than age 45 years.</p><p>The A1C, FPG, or the 2-h OGTT are appropriate for testing. It should be noted that the tests do not necessarily detect diabetes in the same individuals. The efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) has primarily been demonstrated among individuals with IGT, not for individuals with isolated IFG or for individuals with specific A1C levels.</p><p>The appropriate interval between tests is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The rationale for the 3-year interval is that false negatives will be repeated before substantial time elapses, and there is little likelihood that an individual will develop significant complications of diabetes within 3 years of a negative test result. In the modeling study, repeat screening every 3 or 5 years was cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Because of the need for follow-up and discussion of abnormal results, testing should be carried out within the health care setting. Community screening outside a health care setting is not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care. Conversely, there may be failure to ensure appropriate repeat testing for individuals who test negative. Community screening may also be poorly targeted; i.e., it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at low risk (the worried well) or even those already diagnosed.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>B.

(E)</p></list-item></list><p>Generally, people with type 1 diabetes present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and some cases are diagnosed with life-threatening ketoacidosis. Evidence from several studies suggests that measurement of islet autoantibodies in relatives of those with type 1 diabetes identifies individuals who are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Such testing, coupled with education about symptoms of diabetes and follow-up in an observational clinical study, may allow earlier identification of onset of type 1 diabetes and lessen presentation with ketoacidosis at time of diagnosis. This testing may be appropriate in those who have relatives with type 1 diabetes, in the context of clinical research studies (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diabetestrialnet.org">http://www.diabetestrialnet.org</ext-link>). However, widespread clinical testing of asymptomatic low-risk individuals cannot currently be recommended, as it would identify very few individuals in the general population who are at risk. Individuals who screen positive should be counseled about their risk of developing diabetes and symptoms of diabetes, followed closely to prevent development of diabetic ketoacidosis, and informed about clinical trials. Clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of autoimmunity.

This definition facilitated a uniform strategy for detection and classification of GDM, but its limitations were recognized for many years. As the ongoing epidemic of obesity and diabetes has led to more type 2 diabetes in women of childbearing age, the number of pregnant women with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Because of this, it is reasonable to screen women with risk factors for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) for diabetes at their initial prenatal visit, using standard diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Women with diabetes found at this visit should receive a diagnosis of overt, not gestational, diabetes.</p><p>GDM carries risks for the mother and neonate. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), a large-scale (&#x0223c;25,000 pregnant women) multinational epidemiological study, demonstrated that risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased as a function of maternal glycemia at 24&#x02013;28 weeks, even within ranges previously considered normal for pregnancy. For most complications, there was no threshold for risk. These results have led to careful reconsideration of the diagnostic criteria for GDM. After deliberations in 2008&#x02013;2009, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), an international consensus group with representatives from multiple obstetrical and diabetes organizations, including ADA, developed revised recommendations for diagnosing GDM. The group recommended that all women not known to have prior diabetes undergo a 75-g OGTT at 24&#x02013;28 weeks of gestation. Additionally, the group developed diagnostic cut points for the fasting, 1-h, and 2-h plasma glucose measurements that conveyed an odds ratio for adverse outcomes of at least 1.75 compared with women with the mean glucose levels in the HAPO study. Current screening and diagnostic strategies, based on the IADPSG statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>.</p><p>These new criteria will significantly increase the prevalence of GDM, primarily because only one abnormal value, not two, is sufficient to make the diagnosis. The ADA recognizes the anticipated significant increase in the incidence of GDM diagnosed by these criteria and is sensitive to concerns about the &#x0201c;medicalization&#x0201d; of pregnancies previously categorized as normal. These diagnostic criteria changes are being made in the context of worrisome worldwide increases in obesity and diabetes rates, with the intent of optimizing gestational outcomes for women and their babies.</p><p>Admittedly, there are few data from randomized clinical trials regarding therapeutic interventions in women who will now be diagnosed with GDM based on only one blood glucose value above the specified cut points (in contrast to the older criteria that stipulated at least two abnormal values). However, there is emerging observational and retrospective evidence that women diagnosed with the new criteria (even if they would not have been diagnosed with older criteria) have increased rates of poor pregnancy outcomes similar to those of women with GDM by prior criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Expected benefits to these pregnancies and offspring are inferred from intervention trials that focused on women with more mild hyperglycemia than identified using older GDM diagnostic criteria and that found modest benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The frequency of follow-up and blood glucose monitoring for these women is not yet clear, but likely to be less intensive than for women diagnosed by the older criteria. It is important to note that 80&#x02013;90% of women in both of the mild GDM studies (whose glucose values overlapped with the thresholds recommended herein) could be managed with lifestyle therapy alone.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists announced in 2011 that they continue to recommend use of prior diagnostic criteria for GDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Several other countries have adopted the new criteria, and a report from the WHO on this topic is pending at the time of publication of these standards. The National Institutes of Health is planning to hold a consensus development conference on this topic in 2013.</p><p>Because some cases of GDM may represent pre-existing undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, women with a history of GDM should be screened for diabetes 6&#x02013;12 weeks postpartum, using nonpregnant OGTT criteria. Because of their prepartum treatment for hyperglycemia, use of the A1C for diagnosis of persistent diabetes at the postpartum visit is not recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Women with a history of GDM have a greatly increased subsequent risk for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and should be followed up with subsequent screening for the development of diabetes or prediabetes, as outlined in Section II. Lifestyle interventions or metformin should be offered to women with a history of GDM who develop prediabetes, as discussed in Section IV. In the prospective Nurses&#x02019; Health Study II, risk of subsequent diabetes after a history of GDM was significantly lower in women who followed healthy eating patterns. Adjusting for BMI moderately, but not completely, attenuated this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s14"><title>IV.

These include intensive lifestyle modification programs that have been shown to be very effective (&#x0223c;58% reduction after 3 years) and use of the pharmacological agents metformin, &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors, orlistat, and thiazolidinediones, each of which has been shown to decrease incident diabetes to various degrees. Follow-up of all three large studies of lifestyle intervention has shown sustained reduction in the rate of conversion to type 2 diabetes, with 43% reduction at 20 years in the Da Qing study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), 43% reduction at 7 years in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), and 34% reduction at 10 years in the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). A cost-effectiveness model suggested that lifestyle interventions as delivered in the DPP are cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), and actual cost data from the DPP and DPPOS confirm that lifestyle interventions are highly cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Group delivery of the DPP intervention in community settings has the potential to be significantly less expensive while still achieving similar weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).</p><p>Based on the results of clinical trials and the known risks of progression of prediabetes to diabetes, persons with an A1C of 5.7&#x02013;6.4%, IGT, or IFG should be counseled on lifestyle changes with goals similar to those of the DPP (7% weight loss and moderate physical activity of at least 150 min/week). Regarding drug therapy for diabetes prevention, metformin has a strong evidence base and demonstrated long-term safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). For other drugs, issues of cost, side effects, and lack of persistence of effect in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) require consideration. Metformin was less effective than lifestyle modification in the DPP and DPPOS, but may be cost-saving over a 10-year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). It was as effective as lifestyle modification in participants with a BMI of at least 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, but not significantly better than placebo than those over age 60 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In women in the DPP with a history of GDM, metformin and intensive lifestyle modification led to an equivalent 50% reduction in the risk of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Metformin therefore might reasonably be recommended for very high-risk individuals (those with a history of GDM, the very obese, and/or those with more severe or progressive hyperglycemia).</p><p>People with prediabetes often have other cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Assessing and treating these risk factors is an important aspect of reducing cardiometabolic risk. In the DPP and DPPOS, cardiovascular event rates have been very low, perhaps due to appropriate management of cardiovascular risk factors in all arms of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s17"><title>V.

(E)</p></list-item></list><p>Major clinical trials of insulin-treated patients that demonstrated the benefits of intensive glycemic control on diabetes complications have included SMBG as part of multifactorial interventions, suggesting that SMBG is a component of effective therapy. SMBG allows patients to evaluate their individual response to therapy and assess whether glycemic targets are being achieved. Results of SMBG can be useful in preventing hypoglycemia and adjusting medications (particularly prandial insulin doses), medical nutrition therapy (MNT), and physical activity.</p><p>The frequency and timing of SMBG should be dictated by the particular needs and goals of the patient. SMBG is especially important for patients treated with insulin to monitor for and prevent asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Most patients with type 1 diabetes and others on intensive insulin regimens (MDI or insulin pump therapy) should do SMBG at least prior to meals and snacks, occasionally postprandially, at bedtime, prior to exercise, when they suspect low blood glucose, after treating low blood glucose until they are normoglycemic, and prior to critical tasks such as driving. For many patients, this will require testing 6&#x02013;8 times daily, although individual needs may be greater. Although there are few rigorous studies, a database study of almost 27,000 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes showed that, after adjustment for multiple confounders, increased daily frequency of SMBG was significantly associated with lower A1C (&#x02212;0.2% per additional test per day, leveling off at five tests per day) and with fewer acute complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The optimal frequency of SMBG for patients on nonintensive regimens, such as those with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin, is not known, although a number of studies have used fasting SMBG for patient or provider titration of the basal insulin dose.</p><p>The evidence base for SMBG for patients with type 2 diabetes on noninsulin therapy is somewhat mixed. Several randomized trials have called into question the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of routine SMBG in non&#x02013;insulin-treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). A recent meta-analysis suggested that SMBG reduced A1C by 0.25% at 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), while a Cochrane review concluded that the overall effect of SMBG in such patients is small up to 6 months after initiation and subsides after 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>).</p><p>Because the accuracy of SMBG is instrument and user dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), it is important to evaluate each patient&#x02019;s monitoring technique, both initially and at regular intervals thereafter. Optimal use of SMBG requires proper review and interpretation of the data, both by the patient and provider. Among patients who checked their blood glucose at least once daily, many reported taking no action when results were high or low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). In one study of insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with suboptimal initial glycemic control, use of structured SMBG (a paper tool to collect and interpret 7-point SMBG profiles over 3 days at least quarterly) reduced A1C by 0.3% more than in an active control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). Patients should be taught how to use SMBG data to adjust food intake, exercise, or pharmacological therapy to achieve specific goals, and the ongoing need for and frequency of SMBG should be re-evaluated at each routine visit.</p><p>Real-time CGM through the measurement of interstitial glucose (which correlates well with plasma glucose) is available. These sensors require calibration with SMBG, and the latter are still recommended for making acute treatment decisions. CGM devices have alarms for hypo- and hyperglycemic excursions. A 26-week randomized trial of 322 type 1 diabetic patients showed that adults aged &#x02265;25 years using intensive insulin therapy and CGM experienced a 0.5% reduction in A1C (from &#x0223c;7.6 to 7.1%) compared with usual intensive insulin therapy with SMBG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Sensor use in children, teens, and adults to age 24 years did not result in significant A1C lowering, and there was no significant difference in hypoglycemia in any group. Importantly, the greatest predictor of A1C lowering in this study for all age-groups was frequency of sensor use, which was lower in younger age-groups. In a smaller RCT of 129 adults and children with baseline A1C &#x0003c;7.0%, outcomes combining A1C and hypoglycemia favored the group utilizing CGM, suggesting that CGM is also beneficial for individuals with type 1 diabetes who have already achieved excellent control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>).</p><p>A trial comparing CGM plus insulin pump to SMBG plus multiple injections of insulin in adults and children with type 1 diabetes showed significantly greater improvements in A1C with &#x0201c;sensor-augmented pump&#x0201d; therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>), but this trial did not isolate the effect of CGM itself. Overall, meta-analyses suggest that compared with SMBG, CGM lowers A1C by &#x0223c;0.26% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that, in appropriately selected patients who are motivated to wear it most of the time, CGM reduces A1C. The technology may be particularly useful in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, although studies as yet have not shown significant reductions in severe hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). CGM forms the underpinning for the development of pumps that suspend insulin delivery when hypoglycemia is developing and for the burgeoning work on &#x0201c;artificial pancreas&#x0201d; systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s24"><title>b.

Measurement approximately every 3 months determines whether patient&#x02019;s glycemic targets have been reached and maintained. For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician. Some patients with stable glycemia well within target may do well with testing only twice per year, while unstable or highly intensively managed patients (e.g., pregnant type 1 diabetic women) may be tested more frequently than every 3 months. The availability of the A1C result at the time that the patient is seen (POC testing) has been reported in small studies to result in increased intensification of therapy and improvement in glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>). However, two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses found no significant difference in A1C between POC and laboratory A1C usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>).</p><p>The A1C test is subject to certain limitations.

In addition, A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetic patients or type 2 diabetic patients with severe insulin deficiency), glycemic control is best judged by the combination of results of self-monitoring and the A1C. The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient&#x02019;s meter (or the patient&#x02019;s reported SMBG results) and the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref> contains the correlation between A1C levels and mean plasma glucose levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial utilizing frequent SMBG and CGM in 507 adults (83% Caucasian) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>). The ADA and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry have determined that the correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. The table in pre-2009 versions of the &#x0201c;Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes&#x0201d; describing the correlation between A1C and mean glucose was derived from relatively sparse data (one 7-point profile over 1 day per A1C reading) in the primarily Caucasian type 1 diabetic participants in the DCCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>).

Whether there are significant differences in how A1C relates to average glucose in children or in African American patients is an area for further study.

The DCCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>), a prospective RCT of intensive versus standard glycemic control in patients with relatively recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes, showed definitively that improved glycemic control is associated with significantly decreased rates of microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) and neuropathic complications. Follow-up of the DCCT cohorts in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>) demonstrated persistence of these microvascular benefits in previously intensively treated subjects, even though their glycemic control approximated that of previous standard arm subjects during follow-up.</p><p>The Kumamoto Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>) confirmed that intensive glycemic control was associated with significantly decreased rates of microvascular and neuropathic complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Long-term follow-up of the UKPDS cohorts showed persistence of the effect of early glycemic control on most microvascular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>).</p><p>Subsequent trials in patients with more long-standing type 2 diabetes, designed primarily to look at the role of intensive glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes, also confirmed a benefit, although more modest, on onset or progression of microvascular complications. The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) showed significant reductions in albuminuria with intensive (achieved median A1C 6.9%) compared with standard glycemic control, but no difference in retinopathy and neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>). The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study of intensive versus standard glycemic control in type 2 diabetes found a statistically significant reduction in albuminuria, but not in neuropathy or retinopathy, with an A1C target of &#x0003c;6.5% (achieved median A1C 6.3%) compared with standard therapy achieving a median A1C of 7.0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>). Analyses from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial have shown lower rates of onset or progression of early-stage microvascular complications in the intensive glycemic control arm compared with the standard arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>).</p><p>Epidemiological analyses of the DCCT and UKPDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>) demonstrate a curvilinear relationship between A1C and microvascular complications. Such analyses suggest that, on a population level, the greatest number of complications will be averted by taking patients from very poor control to fair or good control. These analyses also suggest that further lowering of A1C from 7 to 6% is associated with further reduction in the risk of microvascular complications, albeit the absolute risk reductions become much smaller. Given the substantially increased risk of hypoglycemia (particularly in those with type 1 diabetes, but also in the recent type 2 diabetes trials), the concerning mortality findings in the ACCORD trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>), and the relatively much greater effort required to achieve near-normoglycemia, the risks of lower glycemic targets may outweigh the potential benefits on microvascular complications on a population level. However, selected individual patients, especially those with little comorbidity and long life expectancy (who may reap the benefits of further lowering of glycemia below 7%), may, based on provider judgment and patient preferences, adopt more intensive glycemic targets (e.g., an A1C target &#x0003c;6.5%) as long as significant hypoglycemia does not become a barrier.</p><p>CVD, a more common cause of death in populations with diabetes than microvascular complications, is less clearly impacted by levels of hyperglycemia or the intensity of glycemic control. In the DCCT, there was a trend toward lower risk of CVD events with intensive control, and in 9-year post-DCCT follow-up of the EDIC cohort participants previously randomized to the intensive arm had a significant 57% reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or CVD death compared with those previously in the standard arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>). The benefit of intensive glycemic control in this type 1 diabetic cohort has recently been shown to persist for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>).</p><p>In type 2 diabetes, there is evidence that more intensive treatment of glycemia in newly diagnosed patients may reduce long-term CVD rates. During the UKPDS trial, there was a 16% reduction in cardiovascular events (combined fatal or nonfatal MI and sudden death) in the intensive glycemic control arm that did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.052), and there was no suggestion of benefit on other CVD outcomes such as stroke. However, after 10 years of follow-up, those originally randomized to intensive glycemic control had significant long-term reductions in MI (15% with sulfonylurea or insulin as initial pharmacotherapy, 33% with metformin as initial pharmacotherapy) and in all-cause mortality (13% and 27%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>).</p><p>Three more recent large trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT) suggested no significant reduction in CVD outcomes with intensive glycemic control in participants who had more advanced type 2 diabetes than UKPDS participants. All three of these trials were conducted in participants with more long-standing diabetes (mean duration 8&#x02013;11 years) and either known CVD or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Details of these three studies are reviewed extensively in an ADA position statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>).</p><p>The ACCORD study enrolled participants with either known CVD or two or more major cardiovascular risk factors and randomized them to intensive glycemic control (goal A1C &#x0003c;6%) or standard glycemic control (goal A1C 7&#x02013;8%). The glycemic control comparison was halted early due to the finding of an increased rate of mortality in the intensive arm compared with the standard arm (1.41% vs. 1.14% per year; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01&#x02013;1.46), with a similar increase in cardiovascular deaths. This increase in mortality in the intensive glycemic control arm was seen in all prespecified patient subgroups. The primary outcome of ACCORD (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death) was nonsignificantly lower in the intensive glycemic control group due to a reduction in nonfatal MI, both when the glycemic control comparison was halted and all participants transitioned to the standard glycemic control intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>), and at completion of the planned follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>).</p><p>Exploratory analyses of the mortality findings of ACCORD (evaluating variables including weight gain, use of any specific drug or drug combination, and hypoglycemia) were reportedly unable to identify a clear explanation for the excess mortality in the intensive arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>). The ACCORD investigators subsequently published additional epidemiological analyses showing no increase in mortality in the intensive arm participants who achieved A1C levels below 7% nor in those who lowered their A1C quickly after trial enrollment. In fact, although there was no A1C level at which intensive arm participants had significantly lower mortality than standard arm participants, the highest risk for mortality was observed in intensive arm participants with the highest A1C levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>).</p><p>The role of hypoglycemia in the excess mortality findings was also complex. Severe hypoglycemia was significantly more likely in participants randomized to the intensive glycemic control arm. However, excess mortality in the intensive versus standard arms was only significant for participants with no severe hypoglycemia, and not for those with one or more episodes. Severe hypoglycemia was associated with excess mortality in either arm, but the association was stronger in those randomized to the standard glycemic control arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>). Unlike the case with the DCCT trial, where lower achieved A1C levels were related to significantly increased rates of severe hypoglycemia, in ACCORD every 1% decline in A1C from baseline to 4 months into the trial was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of severe hypoglycemia in both arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>).</p><p>The primary outcome of ADVANCE was a combination of microvascular events (nephropathy and retinopathy) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death). Intensive glycemic control (to a goal A1C &#x0003c;6.5% vs. treatment to local standards) significantly reduced the primary end point. However, this was due to a significant reduction in the microvascular outcome, primarily development of macroalbuminuria, with no significant reduction in the macrovascular outcome. There was no difference in overall or cardiovascular mortality between the intensive compared with the standard glycemic control arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>).</p><p>The VADT randomized participants with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on insulin or maximal-dose oral agents (median entry A1C 9.4%) to a strategy of intensive glycemic control (goal A1C &#x0003c;6.0%) or standard glycemic control, with a planned A1C separation of at least 1.5%. The primary outcome of the VADT was a composite of CVD events. The cumulative primary outcome was nonsignificantly lower in the intensive arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>). An ancillary study of the VADT demonstrated that intensive glycemic control significantly reduced the primary CVD outcome in individuals with less atherosclerosis at baseline (assessed by coronary calcium) but not in persons with more extensive baseline atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>). A post hoc analysis showed a complex relationship between duration of diabetes before glycemic intensification and mortality: mortality in the intensive vs. standard glycemic control arm was inversely related to duration of diabetes at the time of study enrollment. Those with diabetes duration less than 15 years had a mortality benefit in the intensive arm, while those with duration of 20 years or more had higher mortality in the intensive arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>).</p><p>The evidence for a cardiovascular benefit of intensive glycemic control primarily rests on long-term follow-up of study cohorts treated early in the course of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and subset analyses of ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT. A group-level meta-analysis of the latter three trials suggests that glucose lowering has a modest (9%) but statistically significant reduction in major CVD outcomes, primarily nonfatal MI, with no significant effect on mortality. However, heterogeneity of the mortality effects across studies was noted, precluding firm summary measures of the mortality effects. A prespecified subgroup analysis suggested that major CVD outcome reduction occurred in patients without known CVD at baseline (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74&#x02013;0.94) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>). Conversely, the mortality findings in ACCORD and subgroup analyses of the VADT suggest that the potential risks of intensive glycemic control may outweigh its benefits in some patients, such as those with very long duration of diabetes, known history of severe hypoglycemia, advanced atherosclerosis, and advanced age/frailty. Certainly, providers should be vigilant in preventing severe hypoglycemia in patients with advanced disease and should not aggressively attempt to achieve near-normal A1C levels in patients in whom such a target cannot be safely and reasonably easily achieved. Severe or frequent hypoglycemia is an absolute indication for the modification of treatment regimens, including setting higher glycemic goals. Many factors, including patient preferences, should be taken into account when developing a patient&#x02019;s individualized goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>).</p><p>Recommended glycemic goals for many nonpregnant adults are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">Table 9</xref>. The recommendations are based on those for A1C values, with listed blood glucose levels that appear to correlate with achievement of an A1C of &#x0003c;7%. The issue of pre- versus postprandial SMBG targets is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>). Elevated postchallenge (2-h OGTT) glucose values have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of FPG in some epidemiological studies. In diabetic subjects, some surrogate measures of vascular pathology, such as endothelial dysfunction, are negatively affected by postprandial hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>). It is clear that postprandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial hyperglycemia, contributes to elevated A1C levels, with its relative contribution being higher at A1C levels that are closer to 7%. However, outcome studies have clearly shown A1C to be the primary predictor of complications, and landmark glycemic control trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS relied overwhelmingly on preprandial SMBG. Additionally, an RCT in patients with known CVD found no CVD benefit of insulin regimens targeting postprandial glucose compared with those targeting preprandial glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>). A reasonable recommendation for postprandial testing and targets is that for individuals who have premeal glucose values within target but have A1C values above target, monitoring postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) 1&#x02013;2 h after the start of the meal and treatment aimed at reducing PPG values to &#x0003c;180 mg/dL may help lower A1C.</p><table-wrap id="T9" position="float"><label>Table 9</label><caption><p>Summary of glycemic recommendations for many nonpregnant adults with diabetes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A1C</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;7.0%*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preprandial capillary plasma glucose</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">70&#x02013;130 mg/dL* (3.9&#x02013;7.2 mmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peak postprandial capillary plasma glucose<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn7">&#x02020;</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;180 mg/dL* (&#x0003c;10.0 mmol/L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022;*Goals should be individualized based on:</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">duration of diabetes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">age/life expectancy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">comorbid conditions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">known CVD or advanced microvascular complications</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hypoglycemia unawareness</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">individual patient considerations</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; Postprandial glucose may be targeted if A1C goals are not met despite reaching preprandial glucose goals</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn7"><p>&#x02020;Postprandial glucose measurements should be made 1&#x02013;2 h after the beginning of the meal, generally peak levels in patients with diabetes.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Glycemic goals for children are provided in Section VIII.A.1.a.

The position statement reaffirms metformin as the preferred initial agent, barring contraindication or intolerance, either in addition to lifestyle counseling and support for weight loss and exercise, or when lifestyle efforts alone have not achieved or maintained glycemic goals. Metformin has a long-standing evidence base for efficacy and safety, is inexpensive, and may reduce risk of cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>). When metformin fails to achieve or maintain glycemic goals, another agent should be added. Although there are a number of trials comparing dual therapy to metformin alone, few directly compare drugs as add-on therapy. Comparative effectiveness meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>) suggest that overall each new class of noninsulin agents added to initial therapy lowers A1C around 0.9&#x02013;1.1%.</p><p>Many patients with type 2 diabetes eventually benefit from insulin therapy. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes and its therapies should regularly be explained in a matter-of-fact manner to patients, avoiding using insulin as a threat or describing it as a failure or punishment. Providing patients with an algorithm for self-titration of insulin doses based on SMBG results improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients initiating insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>).

In addition to its role in preventing and controlling diabetes, the ADA recognizes the importance of nutrition as an essential component of an overall healthy lifestyle. A full review of the evidence regarding nutrition in preventing and controlling diabetes and its complications and additional nutrition-related recommendations can be found in the ADA position statement &#x0201c;Nutrition Recommendations and Interventions for Diabetes&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>), which is being updated as of 2013. Achieving nutrition-related goals requires a coordinated team effort that includes the active involvement of the person with prediabetes or diabetes. Because of the complexity of nutrition issues, it is recommended that a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable and skilled in implementing nutrition therapy into diabetes management and education be the team member who provides MNT.</p><p>Clinical trials/outcome studies of MNT have reported decreases in A1C at 3&#x02013;6 months ranging from 0.25 to 2.9% with higher reductions seen in type 2 diabetes of shorter duration. Multiple studies have demonstrated sustained improvements in A1C at 12 months and longer when a registered dietitian provided follow-up visits ranging from monthly to 3 sessions per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>). Studies in nondiabetic individuals suggest that MNT reduces LDL cholesterol by 15&#x02013;25 mg/dL up to 16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>) and support a role for lifestyle modification in treating hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">124</xref>).</p><p>Although the importance of weight loss for overweight and obese individuals is well documented, an optimal macronutrient distribution and dietary pattern of weight loss diets has not been established. A systematic review of 80 weight loss studies of &#x02265;1-year duration demonstrated that moderate weight loss achieved through diet alone, diet and exercise, and meal replacements can be achieved and maintained (4.8&#x02013;8% weight loss at 12 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>). Both low-fat low-carbohydrate and Mediterranean style eating patterns have been shown to promote weight loss with similar results after 1 to 2 years of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">126</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">129</xref>). A meta-analysis showed that at 6 months, low-carbohydrate diets were associated with greater improvements in triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations than low-fat diets; however, LDL cholesterol was significantly higher on the low-carbohydrate diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">130</xref>).</p><p>Because of the effects of obesity on insulin resistance, weight loss is an important therapeutic objective for overweight or obese individuals who are at risk for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">131</xref>). The multifactorial intensive lifestyle intervention used in the DPP, which included reduced intake of fat and calories, led to weight loss averaging 7% at 6 months and maintenance of 5% weight loss at 3 years, associated with a 58% reduction in incidence of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). An RCT looking at high-risk individuals in Spain showed that the Mediterranean dietary pattern reduced the incidence of diabetes in the absence of weight loss by 52% compared with the low-fat control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132">132</xref>).</p><p>Although our society abounds with examples of high-calorie nutrient-poor foods, large increases in the consumption of SSBs have coincided with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In a meta-analysis of eight prospective cohort studies (<italic>n</italic> = 310,819), a diet high in consumption of SSBs was associated with the development of type 2 diabetes (<italic>n</italic> = 15,043). Individuals in the highest versus lowest quantile of SSB intake had a 26% greater risk of developing diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133">133</xref>).</p><p>For individuals with type 2 diabetes, studies have demonstrated that moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) is associated with decreased insulin resistance, improved measures of glycemia and lipemia, and reduced blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">134</xref>); longer-term studies (&#x02265;52 weeks) showed mixed effects on A1C in adults with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">135</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">137</xref>), and in some studies results were confounded by pharmacological weight loss therapy. Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is a large clinical trial designed to determine whether long-term weight loss will improve glycemia and prevent cardiovascular events in subjects with type 2 diabetes. One-year results of the intensive lifestyle intervention in this trial show an average 8.6% weight loss, significant reduction of A1C, and reduction in several CVD risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">138</xref>), with benefits sustained at 4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>). At the time this article was going to press, the Look AHEAD trial was halted early, after 11 years of follow-up, because there was no significant difference in the primary cardiovascular outcome between the weight loss and standard care group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2012/niddk-19.htm">http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2012/niddk-19.htm</ext-link>). Multiple cardiovascular risk factors were improved with weight loss, and those participants on average were on fewer medications to achieve these improvements.</p><p>Although numerous studies have attempted to identify the optimal mix of macronutrients for meal plans of people with diabetes, a recent systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">140</xref>) confirms that there is no most effective mix that applies broadly, and that macronutrient proportions should be individualized. It must be clearly recognized that regardless of the macronutrient mix, total caloric intake must be appropriate to weight management goal. Further, individualization of the macronutrient composition will depend on the metabolic status of the patient (e.g., lipid profile, renal function) and/or food preferences. A variety of dietary meal patterns are likely effective in managing diabetes including Mediterranean-style, plant-based (vegan or vegetarian), low-fat and lower-carbohydrate eating patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">127</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">141</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">143</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that the RDA for digestible carbohydrate is 130 g/day and is based on providing adequate glucose as the required fuel for the central nervous system without reliance on glucose production from ingested protein or fat.

Mild hypoglycemia may be inconvenient or frightening to patients with diabetes, and more severe hypoglycemia can cause acute harm to the person with diabetes or others, if it causes falls, motor vehicle accidents, or other injury. A large cohort study suggested that among older adults with type 2 diabetes, a history of severe hypoglycemia was associated with greater risk of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B224">224</xref>). Conversely, in a substudy of the ACCORD trial, cognitive impairment at baseline or decline in cognitive function during the trial was significantly associated with subsequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">225</xref>). Evidence from the DCCT/EDIC trial, which involved younger adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, suggested no association of frequency of severe hypoglycemia with cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B226">226</xref>). As discussed in the Section VIII.A.1.a, a few studies have suggested that severe hypoglycemia in very young children is associated with mild impairments in cognitive function.</p><p>As described in the Section V.b.2, severe hypoglycemia was associated with mortality in participants in both the standard and intensive glycemia arms of the ACCORD trial, but the relationships with achieved A1C and treatment intensity were not straightforward. An association of severe hypoglycemia with mortality was also found in the ADVANCE trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B227">227</xref>), but its association with other outcomes such as pulmonary and skin disorders raises the question of whether severe hypoglycemia is a marker for a sicker patient, rather than a cause of mortality. An association of self-reported severe hypoglycemia with 5-year mortality has also been reported in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B228">228</xref>). At the time this statement went to press, the ADA and The Endocrine Society were finalizing a Hypoglycemia Work Group report, where the causes of and associations with hypoglycemia are discussed in depth.</p><p>Treatment of hypoglycemia (plasma glucose &#x0003c;70 mg/dL) requires ingestion of glucose- or carbohydrate-containing foods. The acute glycemic response correlates better with the glucose content than with the carbohydrate content of the food. Although pure glucose is the preferred treatment, any form of carbohydrate that contains glucose will raise blood glucose. Added fat may retard and then prolong the acute glycemic response. Ongoing activity of insulin or insulin secretagogues may lead to recurrence of hypoglycemia unless further food is ingested after recovery.</p><p>Severe hypoglycemia (where the individual requires the assistance of another person and cannot be treated with oral carbohydrate due to confusion or unconsciousness) should be treated using emergency glucagon kits, which require a prescription. Those in close contact with, or having custodial care of, people with hypoglycemia-prone diabetes (family members, roommates, school personnel, child care providers, correctional institution staff, or coworkers) should be instructed in use of such kits. An individual does not need to be a health care professional to safely administer glucagon. Care should be taken to ensure that unexpired glucagon kits are available.</p><p>Prevention of hypoglycemia is a critical component of diabetes management. Particularly for insulin-treated patients, SMBG and, for some patients, CGM to detect incipient hypoglycemia and assess adequacy of treatment are a key component of safe therapy. Patients should understand situations that increase their risk of hypoglycemia, such as when fasting for tests or procedures, during or after intense exercise, and during sleep and that increase the risk of harm to self or others from hypoglycemia, such as with driving. Teaching people with diabetes to balance insulin use, carbohydrate intake, and exercise is a necessary but not always sufficient strategy for prevention. In type 1 diabetes and severely insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes, the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness, or hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, can severely compromise stringent diabetes control and quality of life. The deficient counter-regulatory hormone release and autonomic responses in this syndrome are both risk factors for, and caused by, hypoglycemia. A corollary to this &#x0201c;vicious cycle&#x0201d; is that several weeks of avoidance of hypoglycemia has been demonstrated to improve counter-regulation and awareness to some extent in many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B229">229</xref>). Hence, patients with one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia may benefit from at least short-term relaxation of glycemic targets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s71"><title>L.

Bariatric surgery has been shown to lead to near- or complete normalization of glycemia in &#x0223c;40&#x02013;95% of patients with type 2 diabetes, depending on the study and the surgical procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B230">230</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B232">232</xref>). A meta-analysis of studies of bariatric surgery involving 3,188 patients with diabetes reported that 78% had remission of diabetes (normalization of blood glucose levels in the absence of medications) and that the remission rates were sustained in studies that had follow-up exceeding 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B233">233</xref>). Remission rates tend to be lower with procedures that only constrict the stomach and higher with those that bypass portions of the small intestine. Additionally, there is a suggestion that intestinal bypass procedures may have glycemic effects that are independent of their effects on weight, perhaps involving the incretin axis.</p><p>There is also evidence for diabetes remission in subjects who are less obese. One randomized trial compared adjustable gastric banding to &#x0201c;best available&#x0201d; medical and lifestyle therapy in subjects with type 2 diabetes and BMI 30&#x02013;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B234">234</xref>). Overall, 73% of surgically treated patients achieved &#x0201c;remission&#x0201d; of their diabetes compared with 13% of those treated medically. The latter group lost only 1.7% of body weight, suggesting that their therapy was not optimal. Overall the trial had 60 subjects, and only 13 had a BMI under 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, making it difficult to generalize these results widely to diabetic patients who are less severely obese or with longer duration of diabetes. In a recent nonrandomized study of 66 people with BMI of 30&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 88% of participants had remission of their type 2 diabetes up to 6 years after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B235">235</xref>).</p><p>Bariatric surgery is costly in the short-term and has some risks. Rates of morbidity and mortality directly related to the surgery have been reduced considerably in recent years, with 30-day mortality rates now 0.28%, similar to those of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B236">236</xref>). Longer-term concerns include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, osteoporosis, and rare but often severe hypoglycemia from insulin hypersecretion. Cohort studies attempting to match subjects suggest that the procedure may reduce longer-term mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B237">237</xref>).

Propensity score&#x02013;adjusted analyses of older severely obese patients with high baseline mortality in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers found that the use of bariatric surgery was not associated with decreased mortality compared with usual care during a mean 6.7 years of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B241">241</xref>). A study that followed patients who had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) for 12 years found that 60% were satisfied with the procedure.

At least 29 outbreaks of HBV in long-term care facilities and hospitals have been reported to the CDC, with the majority involving adults with diabetes receiving &#x0201c;assisted blood glucose monitoring,&#x0201d; in which such monitoring is done by a health care professional with responsibility for more than one patient. HBV is highly transmissible and stable for long periods of time on surfaces such as lancing devices and blood glucose meters, even when no blood is visible. Blood sufficient to transmit the virus has also been found in the reservoirs of insulin pens, resulting in warnings against sharing such devices between patients.</p><p>The CDC analyses suggest that, excluding persons with HBV-related risk behaviors, acute HBV infection is about twice as high among adults with diabetes aged &#x02265;23 years compared with adults without diabetes. Seroprevalence of antibody to HBV core antigen, suggesting past or current infection, is 60% higher among adults with diabetes than those without, and there is some evidence that diabetes imparts a higher HBV case fatality rate. The age differentiation in the recommendations stems from CDC economic models suggesting that vaccination of adults with diabetes who were aged 20&#x02013;59 years would cost an estimated $75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved, while cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved increased significantly at higher ages.

Similar finding emerged from an analysis of another trial, but additionally those with achieved systolic blood pressure (&#x0003c;115 mmHg) had increased rates of CVD events (though lower rates of stroke) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B261">261</xref>).</p><p>Observational data, including those derived from clinical trials, may be inappropriate to use for defining blood pressure targets since sicker patients may have low blood pressure or, conversely, healthier or more adherent patients may achieve goals more readily. A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials of adults with type 2 diabetes comparing prespecified blood pressure targets found no significant reduction in mortality or nonfatal MI. There was a statistically significant 35% relative reduction in stroke, but the absolute risk reduction was only 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B262">262</xref>). Other outcomes, such as indicators of microvascular complications, were not examined. Another meta-analysis that included both trials comparing blood pressure goals and trials comparing treatment strategies concluded that a systolic treatment goal of 130&#x02013;135 mmHg was acceptable. With goals &#x0003c;130 mmHg, there were greater reductions in stroke, a 10% reduction in mortality, but no reduction of other CVD events and increased rates of serious adverse events. Systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;130 mmHg was associated with reduced onset and progression of albuminuria. However, there was heterogeneity in the measure, rates of more advanced renal disease outcomes were not affected, and there were no significant changes in retinopathy or neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B263">263</xref>).</p><p>This change in the &#x0201c;default&#x0201d; systolic blood pressure target is not meant to downplay the importance of treating hypertension in patients with diabetes or to imply that lower targets than &#x0003c;140 mmHg are generally inappropriate. The clear body of evidence that systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg is harmful suggests that clinicians should promptly initiate and titrate therapy in an ongoing fashion to achieve and maintain systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg in virtually all patients. Additionally, patients with long life expectancy (in whom there may be renal benefits from long-term stricter blood pressure control) or those in whom stroke risk is a concern might, as part of shared decision making, appropriately have lower systolic targets such as &#x0003c;130 mmHg. This would especially be the case if this can be achieved with few drugs and without side effects of therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s84"><title>Treatment strategies</title><p>Although there are no well-controlled studies of diet and exercise in the treatment of elevated blood pressure or hypertension in individuals with diabetes, the DASH study in nondiabetic individuals has shown antihypertensive effects similar to pharmacological monotherapy. Lifestyle therapy consists of reducing sodium intake (to below 1,500 mg/day) and excess body weight; increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables (8&#x02013;10 servings per day), and low-fat dairy products (2&#x02013;3 servings per day); avoiding excessive alcohol consumption (no more than two servings per day for men and no more than one serving per day for women) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B264">264</xref>); and increasing activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B252">252</xref>). These nonpharmacological strategies may also positively affect glycemia and lipid control and as a result should be encouraged in those with even mildly elevated blood pressure. Their effects on cardiovascular events have not been established. Nonpharmacological therapy is reasonable in diabetic individuals with mildly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;120 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;80 mmHg). If the blood pressure is confirmed to be &#x02265;140 mmHg systolic and/or &#x02265;80 mmHg diastolic, pharmacological therapy should be initiated along with nonpharmacological therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B252">252</xref>).</p><p>Lowering of blood pressure with regimens based on a variety of antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, &#x003b2;-blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers, has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events. Several studies suggested that ACE inhibitors may be superior to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in reducing cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B265">265</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B267">267</xref>). However, a variety of other studies have shown no specific advantage to ACE inhibitors as initial treatment of hypertension in the general hypertensive population, but rather an advantage on cardiovascular outcomes of initial therapy with low-dose thiazide diuretics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B252">252</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B268">268</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B269">269</xref>).</p><p>In people with diabetes, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may have unique advantages for initial or early therapy of hypertension. In a nonhypertension trial of high-risk individuals, including a large subset with diabetes, an ACE inhibitor reduced CVD outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B270">270</xref>). In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including diabetic subgroups, ARBs have been shown to reduce major CVD outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B271">271</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B274">274</xref>), and in type 2 diabetic patients with significant nephropathy, ARBs were superior to calcium channel blockers for reducing heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B275">275</xref>). Though evidence for distinct advantages of RAS inhibitors on CVD outcomes in diabetes remains conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B255">255</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B269">269</xref>), the high CVD risks associated with diabetes, and the high prevalence of undiagnosed CVD, may still favor recommendations for their use as first-line hypertension therapy in people with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B252">252</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the blood pressure arm of the ADVANCE trial demonstrated that routine administration of a fixed combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide significantly reduced combined microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, as well as CVD and total mortality. The improved outcomes could also have been due to lower achieved blood pressure in the perindopril-indapamide arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B259">259</xref>). Another trial showed a decrease in morbidity and mortality in those receiving benazepril and amlodipine compared with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The compelling benefits of RAS inhibitors in diabetic patients with albuminuria or renal insufficiency provide additional rationale for use of these agents (see Section VI.B). If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, amlodipine, HCTZ, or chlorthalidone can be added. If eGFR is &#x0003c;30 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup>, a loop diuretic rather than HCTZ or chlorthalidone should be prescribed. Titration of and/or addition of further blood pressure medications should be made in timely fashion to overcome clinical inertia in achieving blood pressure targets.</p><p>Evidence is emerging that health information technology can be used safely and effectively as a tool to enable attainment of blood pressure goals. Using a telemonitoring intervention to direct titrations of antihypertensive medications between medical office visits has been demonstrated to have a profound impact on systolic blood pressure control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B276">276</xref>).</p><p>An important caveat is that most patients with hypertension require multiple-drug therapy to reach treatment goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B252">252</xref>). Identifying and addressing barriers to medication adherence (such as cost and side effects) should routinely be done. If blood pressure is refractory despite confirmed adherence to optimal doses of at least three antihypertensive agents of different classifications, one of which should be a diuretic, clinicians should consider an evaluation for secondary forms of hypertension. Growing evidence suggests that there is an association between increase in sleep-time blood pressure and incidence of CVD events. A recent RCT of 448 participants with type 2 diabetes and hypertension demonstrated reduced cardiovascular events and mortality with median follow-up of 5.4 years if at least one antihypertensive medication was given at bedtime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B277">277</xref>).</p><p>During pregnancy in diabetic women with chronic hypertension, target blood pressure goals of systolic blood pressure 110&#x02013;129 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 65&#x02013;79 mmHg are reasonable, as they contribute to long-term maternal health. Lower blood pressure levels may be associated with impaired fetal growth. During pregnancy, treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is contraindicated because they can cause fetal damage. Antihypertensive drugs known to be effective and safe in pregnancy include methyldopa, labetalol, diltiazem, clonidine, and prazosin. Chronic diuretic use during pregnancy has been associated with restricted maternal plasma volume, which might reduce uteroplacental perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B278">278</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s85"><title>2.

Multiple clinical trials demonstrated significant effects of pharmacological (primarily statin) therapy on CVD outcomes in subjects with CHD and for primary CVD prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B279">279</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B280">280</xref>). Subanalyses of diabetic subgroups of larger trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B281">281</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B285">285</xref>) and trials specifically in subjects with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B286">286</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B287">287</xref>) showed significant primary and secondary prevention of CVD events +/&#x02212; CHD deaths in diabetic populations. Meta-analyses including data from over 18,000 patients with diabetes from 14 randomized trials of statin therapy, followed for a mean of 4.3 years, demonstrate a 9% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality and 13% reduction in vascular mortality, for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B288">288</xref>). As is the case in nondiabetic individuals, absolute reductions in &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; CVD outcomes (CHD death and nonfatal MI) are greatest in people with high baseline CVD risk (known CVD and/or very high LDL cholesterol levels), but overall the benefits of statin therapy in people with diabetes at moderate or high risk for CVD are convincing.</p><p>There is an increased risk of incident diabetes with statin use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B289">289</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B290">290</xref>), which may be limited to those with risk factors for diabetes. These patients may benefit additionally from diabetes screening when on statin therapy. In an analysis of one of the initial studies suggesting that statins are linked to risk of diabetes, the cardiovascular event rate reduction with statins outweighed the risk of incident diabetes even for patients at highest risk for diabetes. The absolute risk increase was small (over 5 years of follow-up, 1.2% of participants on placebo developed diabetes and 1.5% on rosuvastatin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B291">291</xref>). The relative risk-benefit ratio favoring statins is further supported by meta-analysis of individual data of over 170,000 persons from 27 randomized trials. This demonstrated that individuals at low risk of vascular disease, including those undergoing primary prevention, received benefits from statins that included reductions in major vascular events and vascular death without increase in incidence of cancer or deaths from other causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B280">280</xref>).</p><p>Low levels of HDL cholesterol, often associated with elevated triglyceride levels, are the most prevalent pattern of dyslipidemia in persons with type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence base for drugs that target these lipid fractions is significantly less robust than that for statin therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B292">292</xref>). Nicotinic acid has been shown to reduce CVD outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B293">293</xref>), although the study was done in a nondiabetic cohort. Gemfibrozil has been shown to decrease rates of CVD events in subjects without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B294">294</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B295">295</xref>) and in the diabetic subgroup of one of the larger trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B294">294</xref>). However, in a large trial specific to diabetic patients, fenofibrate failed to reduce overall cardiovascular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B296">296</xref>).</p><p>Combination therapy, with a statin and a fibrate or statin and niacin, may be efficacious for treatment for all three lipid fractions, but this combination is associated with an increased risk for abnormal transaminase levels, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis. The risk of rhabdomyolysis is higher with higher doses of statins and with renal insufficiency and seems to be lower when statins are combined with fenofibrate than gemfibrozil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B297">297</xref>). In the ACCORD study, the combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin did not reduce the rate of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke, as compared with simvastatin alone, in patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk for CVD. Prespecified subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity in treatment effects according to sex, with a benefit of combination therapy for men and possible harm for women, and a possible benefit for patients with both triglyceride level &#x02265;204 mg/dL and HDL cholesterol level &#x02264;34 mg/dL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B298">298</xref>). The AIM-HIGH trial randomized over 3,000 patients (about one-third with diabetes) with established CVD, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels of 150&#x02013;400 mg/dL to statin therapy plus extended release niacin or matching placebo. The trial was halted early due to lack of efficacy on the primary CVD outcome and a possible increase in ischemic stroke in those on combination therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B299">299</xref>). Hence, combination lipid-lowering therapy cannot be broadly recommended.</p></sec><sec id="s90"><title>Dyslipidemia treatment and target lipid levels</title><p>For most patients with diabetes, the first priority of dyslipidemia therapy (unless severe hypertriglyceridemia with risk of pancreatitis is the immediate issue) is to lower LDL cholesterol to a target goal of &#x0003c;100 mg/dL (2.60 mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B300">300</xref>). Lifestyle intervention, including MNT, increased physical activity, weight loss, and smoking cessation, may allow some patients to reach lipid goals. Nutrition intervention should be tailored according to each patient&#x02019;s age, type of diabetes, pharmacological treatment, lipid levels, and other medical conditions and should focus on the reduction of saturated fat, cholesterol, and <italic>trans</italic> unsaturated fat intake and increases in n-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber (such as in oats, legumes, citrus), and plant stanols/sterols. Glycemic control can also beneficially modify plasma lipid levels, particularly in patients with very high triglycerides and poor glycemic control.</p><p>In those with clinical CVD or over age 40 years with other CVD risk factors, pharmacological treatment should be added to lifestyle therapy regardless of baseline lipid levels. Statins are the drugs of choice for LDL cholesterol lowering and cardioprotection. In patients other than those described above, statin treatment should be considered if there is an inadequate LDL cholesterol response to lifestyle modifications and improved glucose control, or if the patient has increased cardiovascular risk (e.g., multiple cardiovascular risk factors or long duration of diabetes). Very little clinical trial evidence exists for type 2 diabetic patients under the age 40 years, or for type 1 diabetic patients of any age. In the Heart Protection Study (lower age limit 40 years), the subgroup of &#x0223c;600 patients with type 1 diabetes had a reduction in risk proportionately similar to that of patients with type 2 diabetes, although not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B282">282</xref>). Although the data are not definitive, consideration should be given to similar lipid-lowering goals in type 1 diabetic patients as in type 2 diabetic patients, particularly if they have other cardiovascular risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s91"><title>Alternative lipoprotein goals</title><p>Virtually all trials of statins and CVD outcome tested specific doses of statins against placebo, other doses of statin, or other statins, rather than aiming for specific LDL cholesterol goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B301">301</xref>). Placebo-controlled trials generally achieved LDL cholesterol reductions of 30&#x02013;40% from baseline. Hence, LDL cholesterol lowering of this magnitude is an acceptable outcome for patients who cannot reach LDL cholesterol goals due to severe baseline elevations in LDL cholesterol and/or intolerance of maximal, or any, statin doses. Additionally for those with baseline LDL cholesterol minimally above 100 mg/dL, prescribing statin therapy to lower LDL cholesterol about 30&#x02013;40% from baseline is probably more effective than prescribing just enough to get LDL cholesterol slightly below 100 mg/dL.</p><p>Clinical trials in high-risk patients, such as those with acute coronary syndromes or previous cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B302">302</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B304">304</xref>), have demonstrated that more aggressive therapy with high doses of statins to achieve an LDL cholesterol of &#x0003c;70 mg/dL led to a significant reduction in further events. Therefore, a reduction in LDL cholesterol to a goal of &#x0003c;70 mg/dL is an option in very high-risk diabetic patients with overt CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B305">305</xref>). Some experts recommend a greater focus on non&#x02013;HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), or lipoprotein particle measurements to assess residual CVD risk in statin-treated patients who are likely to have small LDL particles, such as people with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B306">306</xref>), but it is unclear whether clinical management would change with these measurements.</p><p>In individual patients, LDL cholesterol lowering with statins is highly variable, and this variable response is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B307">307</xref>). Reduction of CVD events with statins correlates very closely with LDL cholesterol lowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B279">279</xref>). If initial attempts to prescribe a statin leads to side effects, clinicians should attempt to find a dose or alternative statin that the patient can tolerate. There is evidence for significant LDL cholesterol lowering from even extremely low, less than daily, statin doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B308">308</xref>). When maximally tolerated doses of statins fail to significantly lower LDL cholesterol (&#x0003c;30% reduction from the patient&#x02019;s baseline), there is no strong evidence that combination therapy should be used to achieve additional LDL cholesterol lowering. Niacin, fenofibrate, ezetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants all offer additional LDL cholesterol lowering to statins alone, but without evidence that such combination therapy for LDL cholesterol lowering provides a significant increment in CVD risk reduction over statin therapy alone.</p></sec><sec id="s92"><title>Treatment of other lipoprotein fractions or targets</title><p>Hypertriglyceridemia should be addressed with dietary and lifestyle changes. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (&#x0003e;1,000 mg/dL) may warrant immediate pharmacological therapy (fibric acid derivative, niacin, or fish oil) to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. In the absence of severe hypertriglyceridemia, therapy targeting HDL cholesterol or triglycerides lacks the strong evidence base of statin therapy. If the HDL cholesterol is &#x0003c;40 mg/dL and the LDL cholesterol is between 100 and 129 mg/dL, a fibrate or niacin might be used, especially if a patient is intolerant to statins.

It can significantly increase blood glucose at high doses, but at modest doses (750&#x02013;2,000 mg/day) significant improvements in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels are accompanied by only modest changes in glucose that are generally amenable to adjustment of diabetes therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B299">299</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B309">309</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B310">310</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T10">Table 10</xref> summarizes common treatment goals for A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.</p><table-wrap id="T10" position="float"><label>Table 10</label><caption><p>Summary of recommendations for glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for most adults with diabetes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A1C</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;7.0%<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn8">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood pressure</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;140/80 mmHg<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn8">**</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lipids</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LDL cholesterol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;100 mg/dL (&#x0003c;2.6 mmol/L)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn8">&#x02020;</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Statin therapy for those with history of MI or age over 40+ other risk factors</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn8"><label>*</label><p>More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients.

These trials collectively enrolled over 95,000 participants, including almost 4,000 with diabetes. Overall, they found that aspirin reduced the risk of vascular events by 12% (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82&#x02013;0.94). The largest reduction was for nonfatal MI with little effect on CHD death (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78&#x02013;1.15) or total stroke. There was some evidence of a difference in aspirin effect by sex.

The confidence interval was wider for those with diabetes because of their smaller number.</p><p>Based on the currently available evidence, aspirin appears to have a modest effect on ischemic vascular events with the absolute decrease in events depending on the underlying CVD risk. The main adverse effects appear to be an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The excess risk may be as high as 1&#x02013;5 per 1,000 per year in real-world settings.

Low-dose (75&#x02013;162 mg/day) aspirin use for primary prevention is reasonable for adults with diabetes and no previous history of vascular disease who are at increased CVD risk (10-year risk of CVD events over 10%) and who are not at increased risk for bleeding. This generally includes most men over age 50 years and women over age 60 years who also have one or more of the following major risk factors: <italic>1</italic>) smoking, <italic>2</italic>) hypertension, <italic>3</italic>) dyslipidemia, <italic>4</italic>) family history of premature CVD, and <italic>5</italic>) albuminuria.</p><p>However, aspirin is no longer recommended for those at low CVD risk (women under age 60 years and men under age 50 years with no major CVD risk factors; 10-year CVD risk under 5%) as the low benefit is likely to be outweighed by the risks of significant bleeding. Clinical judgment should be used for those at intermediate risk (younger patients with one or more risk factors, or older patients with no risk factors; those with 10-year CVD risk of 5&#x02013;10%) until further research is available. Use of aspirin in patients under the age of 21 years is contraindicated due to the associated risk of Reye syndrome.</p><p>Average daily dosages used in most clinical trials involving patients with diabetes ranged from 50 to 650 mg but were mostly in the range of 100 to 325 mg/day. There is little evidence to support any specific dose, but using the lowest possible dosage may help reduce side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B316">316</xref>). In the U.S., the most common low dose tablet is 81 mg. Although platelets from patients with diabetes have altered function, it is unclear what, if any, impact that finding has on the required dose of aspirin for cardioprotective effects in the patient with diabetes. Many alternate pathways for platelet activation exist that are independent of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> and thus not sensitive to the effects of aspirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B317">317</xref>). Therefore, while &#x0201c;aspirin resistance&#x0201d; appears higher in the diabetic patients when measured by a variety of ex vivo and in vitro methods (platelet aggregometry, measurement of thromboxane B<sub>2</sub>), these observations alone are insufficient to empirically recommend higher doses of aspirin be used in the diabetic patient at this time.</p><p>Clopidogrel has been demonstrated to reduce CVD events in diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B318">318</xref>). It is recommended as adjunctive therapy in the first year after an acute coronary syndrome or as alternative therapy in aspirin-intolerant patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s95"><title>4.

Much of the work documenting the impact of smoking on health did not separately discuss results on subsets of individuals with diabetes, but suggests that the identified risks are at least equivalent to those found in the general population. Other studies of individuals with diabetes consistently demonstrate that smokers have a heightened risk of CVD, premature death, and increased rate of microvascular complications of diabetes. Smoking may have a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. One study in smokers with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes found that smoking cessation was associated with amelioration of metabolic parameters and reduced blood pressure and albuminuria at 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B319">319</xref>).</p><p>The routine and thorough assessment of tobacco use is important as a means of preventing smoking or encouraging cessation. A number of large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of brief counseling in smoking cessation, including the use of quitlines, in the reduction of tobacco use.

To identify the presence of CAD in diabetic patients without clear or suggestive symptoms, a risk factor&#x02013;based approach to the initial diagnostic evaluation and subsequent follow-up has intuitive appeal. However, recent studies concluded that using this approach fails to identify which patients with type 2 diabetes will have silent ischemia on screening tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B201">201</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B321">321</xref>).</p><p>Candidates for cardiac testing include those with <italic>1</italic>) typical or atypical cardiac symptoms and <italic>2</italic>) an abnormal resting ECG. The screening of asymptomatic patients remains controversial. Intensive medical therapy that would be indicated anyway for diabetic patients at high risk for CVD seems to provide equal outcomes to invasive revascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B322">322</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B323">323</xref>). There is also some evidence that silent myocardial ischemia may reverse over time, adding to the controversy concerning aggressive screening strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B324">324</xref>). Finally, a recent randomized observational trial demonstrated no clinical benefit to routine screening of asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes and normal ECGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B325">325</xref>). Despite abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging in more than one in five patients, cardiac outcomes were essentially equal (and very low) in screened compared with unscreened patients. Accordingly, the overall effectiveness, especially the cost-effectiveness, of such an indiscriminate screening strategy is now questioned.</p><p>Newer noninvasive CAD screening methods, such as computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography have gained in popularity. These tests infer the presence of coronary atherosclerosis by measuring the amount of calcium in coronary arteries and, in some circumstances, by direct visualization of luminal stenoses. Although asymptomatic diabetic patients found to have a higher coronary disease burden have more future cardiac events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B326">326</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B328">328</xref>), the role of these tests beyond risk stratification is not clear. Their routine use leads to radiation exposure and may result in unnecessary invasive testing such as coronary angiography and revascularization procedures. The ultimate balance of benefit, cost, and risks of such an approach in asymptomatic patients remains controversial, particularly in the modern setting of aggressive CVD risk factor control.</p><p>In all patients with diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed at least annually. These risk factors include dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, a positive family history of premature coronary disease, and the presence of micro- or macroalbuminuria. Abnormal risk factors should be treated as described elsewhere in these guidelines. Patients at increased CHD risk should receive aspirin and a statin, and ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy if hypertensive, unless there are contraindications to a particular drug class. Although clear benefit exists for ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy in patients with nephropathy or hypertension, the benefits in patients with CVD in the absence of these conditions are less clear, especially when LDL cholesterol is concomitantly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B329">329</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B330">330</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s101"><title>B.

Persistent albuminuria in the range of 30&#x02013;299 mg/24 h (historically called microalbuminuria) has been shown to be the earliest stage of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes and a marker for development of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. It is also a well-established marker of increased CVD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B331">331</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B332">332</xref>). Patients with microalbuminuria who progress to more significant levels (&#x02265;300 mg/24 h, historically called macroalbuminuria) are likely to progress to ESRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B333">333</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B334">334</xref>). However, a number of interventions have been demonstrated to reduce the risk and slow the progression of renal disease.</p><p>Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of increased urinary albumin excretion in patients with type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B335">335</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B336">336</xref>) and type 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>) diabetes. The UKPDS provided strong evidence that control of blood pressure can reduce the development of nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B255">255</xref>). In addition, large prospective randomized studies in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated that achievement of lower levels of systolic blood pressure (&#x0003c;140 mmHg) resulting from treatment using ACE inhibitors provides a selective benefit over other antihypertensive drug classes in delaying the progression of increased urinary albumin excretion and can slow the decline in GFR in patients with higher levels of albuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B337">337</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B339">339</xref>).

Several case series and a controlled prospective study suggest that pregnancy in type 1 diabetic patients may aggravate retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B368">368</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B369">369</xref>); laser photocoagulation surgery can minimize this risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B369">369</xref>).</p><p>One of the main motivations for screening for diabetic retinopathy is the long-established efficacy of laser photocoagulation surgery in preventing visual loss. Two large trials, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) in patients with PDR and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) in patients with macular edema, provide the strongest support for the therapeutic benefits of photocoagulation surgery. The DRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B370">370</xref>) showed that panretinal photocoagulation surgery reduced the risk of severe vision loss from PDR from 15.9% in untreated eyes to 6.4% in treated eyes, with greatest risk-benefit ratio in those with baseline disease (disc neovascularization or vitreous hemorrhage).</p><p>The ETDRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B371">371</xref>) established the benefit of focal laser photocoagulation surgery in eyes with macular edema, particularly those with clinically significant macular edema, with reduction of doubling of the visual angle (e.g., 20/50 to 20/100) from 20% in untreated eyes to 8% in treated eyes. The ETDRS also verified the benefits of panretinal photocoagulation for high-risk PDR and in older-onset patients with severe NPDR or less-than-high-risk PDR.</p><p>Laser photocoagulation surgery in both trials was beneficial in reducing the risk of further visual loss, but generally not beneficial in reversing already diminished acuity. Recombinant monoclonal neutralizing antibody to VEGF is a newly approved therapy that improves vision and reduces the need for laser photocoagulation in patients with macular edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B372">372</xref>). Other emerging therapies for retinopathy include sustained intravitreal delivery of fluocinolone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B373">373</xref>) and the possibility of prevention with fenofibrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B374">374</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B375">375</xref>).</p><p>The preventive effects of therapy and the fact that patients with PDR or macular edema may be asymptomatic provide strong support for a screening program to detect diabetic retinopathy. As retinopathy is estimated to take at least 5 years to develop after the onset of hyperglycemia, patients with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes, who generally have had years of undiagnosed diabetes and who have a significant risk of prevalent diabetic retinopathy at time of diabetes diagnosis, should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination soon after diagnosis. Examinations should be performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is knowledgeable and experienced in diagnosing the presence of diabetic retinopathy and is aware of its management. Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients are generally repeated annually. Less frequent exams (every 2&#x02013;3 years) may be cost effective after one or more normal eye exams, and in a population with well-controlled type 2 diabetes there was essentially no risk of development of significant retinopathy with a 3-year interval after a normal examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B376">376</xref>). Examinations will be required more frequently if retinopathy is progressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B377">377</xref>).</p><p>The use of retinal photography with remote reading by experts has great potential in areas where qualified eye care professionals are not available and may also enhance efficiency and reduce costs when the expertise of ophthalmologists can be utilized for more complex examinations and for therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B378">378</xref>). In-person exams are still necessary when the photos are unacceptable and for follow-up of abnormalities detected. Photos are not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam, which should be performed at least initially and at intervals thereafter as recommended by an eye care professional. Results of eye examinations should be documented and transmitted to the referring health care professional.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s112"><title>D.

Although some societies have developed guidelines for screening for CAN, the benefits of sophisticated testing beyond risk stratification are not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B384">384</xref>).</p><p>Gastrointestinal neuropathies (e.g., esophageal enteropathy, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, fecal incontinence) are common, and any section of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. Gastroparesis should be suspected in individuals with erratic glucose control or with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without other identified cause. Evaluation of solid-phase gastric emptying using double-isotope scintigraphy may be done if symptoms are suggestive, but test results often correlate poorly with symptoms. Constipation is the most common lower-gastrointestinal symptom but can alternate with episodes of diarrhea.</p><p>Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is also associated with genitourinary tract disturbances.

An ADA task force was therefore assembled in 2008 to concisely summarize recent literature in this area and then recommend what should be included in the comprehensive foot exam for adult patients with diabetes. Their recommendations are summarized below, but clinicians should refer to the task force report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B385">385</xref>) for further details and practical descriptions of how to perform components of the comprehensive foot examination.</p><p>At least annually, all adults with diabetes should undergo a comprehensive foot examination to identify high-risk conditions. Clinicians should ask about history of previous foot ulceration or amputation, neuropathic or peripheral vascular symptoms, impaired vision, tobacco use, and foot care practices. A general inspection of skin integrity and musculoskeletal deformities should be done in a well-lit room. Vascular assessment would include inspection and assessment of pedal pulses.</p><p>The neurologic exam recommended is designed to identify LOPS rather than early neuropathy. The clinical examination to identify LOPS is simple and requires no expensive equipment. Five simple clinical tests (use of a 10-g monofilament, vibration testing using a 128-Hz tuning fork, tests of pinprick sensation, ankle reflex assessment, and testing vibration perception threshold with a biothesiometer), each with evidence from well-conducted prospective clinical cohort studies, are considered useful in the diagnosis of LOPS in the diabetic foot. The task force agrees that any of the five tests listed could be used by clinicians to identify LOPS, although ideally two of these should be regularly performed during the screening exam&#x02014;normally the 10-g monofilament and one other test. One or more abnormal tests would suggest LOPS, while at least two normal tests (and no abnormal test) would rule out LOPS. The last test listed, vibration assessment using a biothesiometer or similar instrument, is widely used in the U.S.; however, identification of the patient with LOPS can easily be carried out without this or other expensive equipment.</p><p>Initial screening for PAD should include a history for claudication and an assessment of the pedal pulses. A diagnostic ABI should be performed in any patient with symptoms of PAD. Due to the high estimated prevalence of PAD in patients with diabetes and the fact that many patients with PAD are asymptomatic, an ADA consensus statement on PAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B386">386</xref>) suggested that a screening ABI be performed in patients over 50 years of age and be considered in patients under 50 years of age who have other PAD risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or duration of diabetes &#x0003e;10 years). Refer patients with significant symptoms or a positive ABI for further vascular assessment and consider exercise, medications, and surgical options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B386">386</xref>).</p><p>Patients with diabetes and high-risk foot conditions should be educated regarding their risk factors and appropriate management. Patients at risk should understand the implications of the loss of protective sensation, the importance of foot monitoring on a daily basis, the proper care of the foot, including nail and skin care, and the selection of appropriate footwear. Patients with LOPS should be educated on ways to substitute other sensory modalities (hand palpation, visual inspection) for surveillance of early foot problems. The patients&#x02019; understanding of these issues and their physical ability to conduct proper foot surveillance and care should be assessed. Patients with visual difficulties, physical constraints preventing movement, or cognitive problems that impair their ability to assess the condition of the foot and to institute appropriate responses will need other people, such as family members, to assist in their care.</p><p>People with neuropathy or evidence of increased plantar pressure (e.g., erythema, warmth, callus, or measured pressure) may be adequately managed with well-fitted walking shoes or athletic shoes that cushion the feet and redistribute pressure. Callus can be debrided with a scalpel by a foot care specialist or other health professional with experience and training in foot care. People with bony deformities (e.g., hammertoes, prominent metatarsal heads, bunions) may need extra-wide or -depth shoes. People with extreme bony deformities (e.g., Charcot foot) who cannot be accommodated with commercial therapeutic footwear may need custom-molded shoes.</p><p>Foot ulcers and wound care may require care by a podiatrist, orthopedic or vascular surgeon, or rehabilitation specialist experienced in the management of individuals with diabetes.

Children with diabetes differ from adults in many respects, including changes in insulin sensitivity related to sexual maturity and physical growth, ability to provide self-care, supervision in child care and school, and unique neurologic vulnerability to hypoglycemia and DKA. Attention to such issues as family dynamics, developmental stages, and physiological differences related to sexual maturity are all essential in developing and implementing an optimal diabetes regimen.

Glycemic goals may need to be modified to take into account the fact that most children &#x0003c;6 or 7 years of age have a form of &#x0201c;hypoglycemic unawareness,&#x0201d; including immaturity and a relative inability to recognize and respond to hypoglycemic symptoms, placing them at greater risk for severe hypoglycemia and its sequelae. In addition, and unlike the case in type 1 diabetic adults, young children below the age of 5 years may be at risk for permanent cognitive impairment after episodes of severe hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B413">413</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B415">415</xref>). Furthermore, the DCCT demonstrated that near-normalization of blood glucose levels was more difficult to achieve in adolescents than adults.

(E)</p></list-item></list><p>Major congenital malformations remain the leading cause of mortality and serious morbidity in infants of mothers with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Observational studies indicate that the risk of malformations increases continuously with increasing maternal glycemia during the first 6&#x02013;8 weeks of gestation, as defined by first-trimester A1C concentrations. There is no threshold for A1C values below which risk disappears entirely. However, malformation rates above the 1&#x02013;2% background rate of nondiabetic pregnancies appear to be limited to pregnancies in which first-trimester A1C concentrations are &#x0003e;1% above the normal range for a nondiabetic pregnant woman.</p><p>Preconception care of diabetes appears to reduce the risk of congenital malformations. Five nonrandomized studies compared rates of major malformations in infants between women who participated in preconception diabetes care programs and women who initiated intensive diabetes management after they were already pregnant. The preconception care programs were multidisciplinary and designed to train patients in diabetes self-management with diet, intensified insulin therapy, and SMBG. Goals were set to achieve normal blood glucose concentrations, and &#x0003e;80% of subjects achieved normal A1C concentrations before they became pregnant. In all five studies, the incidence of major congenital malformations in women who participated in preconception care (range 1.0&#x02013;1.7% of infants) was much lower than the incidence in women who did not participate (range 1.4&#x02013;10.9% of infants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>). One limitation of these studies is that participation in preconception care was self-selected rather than randomized. Thus, it is impossible to be certain that the lower malformation rates resulted fully from improved diabetes care. Nonetheless, the evidence supports the concept that malformations can be reduced or prevented by careful management of diabetes before pregnancy.</p><p>Planned pregnancies greatly facilitate preconception diabetes care. Unfortunately, nearly two-thirds of pregnancies in women with diabetes are unplanned, leading to a persistent excess of malformations in infants of diabetic mothers. To minimize the occurrence of these devastating malformations, standard care for all women with diabetes who have childbearing potential, beginning at the onset of puberty or at diagnosis, should include <italic>1</italic>) education about the risk of malformations associated with unplanned pregnancies and poor metabolic control and <italic>2</italic>) use of effective contraception at all times, unless the patient has good metabolic control and is actively trying to conceive.</p><p>Women contemplating pregnancy need to be seen frequently by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of diabetes before and during pregnancy.

Statins are category X (contraindicated for use in pregnancy) and should be discontinued before conception, as should ACE inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B450">450</xref>). ARBs are category C (risk cannot be ruled out) in the first trimester but category D (positive evidence of risk) in later pregnancy and should generally be discontinued before pregnancy. Since many pregnancies are unplanned, health care professionals caring for any woman of childbearing potential should consider the potential risks and benefits of medications that are contraindicated in pregnancy. Women using medications such as statins or ACE inhibitors need ongoing family planning counseling. Among the oral antidiabetic agents, metformin and acarbose are classified as category B (no evidence of risk in humans) and all others as category C. Potential risks and benefits of oral antidiabetic agents in the preconception period must be carefully weighed, recognizing that data are insufficient to establish the safety of these agents in pregnancy.</p><p>For further discussion of preconception care, see the ADA&#x02019;s consensus statement on pre-existing diabetes and pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>) and the position statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B451">451</xref>) on this subject.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s163"><title>C.

The care of older adults with diabetes is complicated by their clinical and functional heterogeneity. Some older individuals developed diabetes years earlier and may have significant complications; others who are newly diagnosed may have had years of undiagnosed diabetes with resultant complications or may have truly recent-onset disease and few or no complications. Some older adults with diabetes are frail and have other underlying chronic conditions, substantial diabetes-related comorbidity, or limited physical or cognitive functioning. Other older individuals with diabetes have little comorbidity and are active. Life expectancies are highly variable for this population, but often longer than clinicians realize. Providers caring for older adults with diabetes must take this heterogeneity into consideration when setting and prioritizing treatment goals.</p><p>There are few long-term studies in older adults demonstrating the benefits of intensive glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control. Patients who can be expected to live long enough to reap the benefits of long-term intensive diabetes management, who have good cognitive and functional function, and who choose to do so via shared decision making may be treated using therapeutic interventions and goals similar to those for younger adults with diabetes. As with all patients, DSME and ongoing DSMS are vital components of diabetes care for older adults and their caregivers.</p><p>For patients with advanced diabetes complications, life-limiting comorbid illness, or substantial cognitive or functional impairment, it is reasonable to set less intensive glycemic target goals. These patients are less likely to benefit from reducing the risk of microvascular complications and more likely to suffer serious adverse effects from hypoglycemia. However, patients with poorly controlled diabetes may be subject to acute complications of diabetes, including dehydration, poor wound healing, and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma. Glycemic goals at a minimum should avoid these consequences.</p><p>Although control of hyperglycemia may be important in older individuals with diabetes, greater reductions in morbidity and mortality may result from control of other cardiovascular risk factors rather than from tight glycemic control alone. There is strong evidence from clinical trials of the value of treating hypertension in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B453">453</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B454">454</xref>). There is less evidence for lipid-lowering and aspirin therapy, although the benefits of these interventions for primary and secondary prevention are likely to apply to older adults whose life expectancies equal or exceed the time frames seen in clinical trials.</p><p>Special care is required in prescribing and monitoring pharmacological therapy in older adults. Costs may be a significant factor, especially since older adults tend to be on many medications. Metformin may be contraindicated because of renal insufficiency or significant heart failure. Thiazolidinediones, if used at all, should be used very cautiously in those with, or at risk for, CHF and have also been associated with fractures. Sulfonylureas, other insulin secretagogues, and insulin can cause hypoglycemia. Insulin use requires that patients or caregivers have good visual and motor skills and cognitive ability. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have few side effects, but their costs may be a barrier to some older patients; the latter is also the case for GLP-1 agonists.</p><p>Screening for diabetes complications in older adults also should be individualized. Particular attention should be paid to complications that can develop over short periods of time and/or that would significantly impair functional status, such as visual and lower-extremity complications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s165"><title>D.

The difficulty distinguishing between the second and third categories during the hospitalization may be overcome by measuring an A1C in undiagnosed patients with hyperglycemia, as long as conditions interfering with A1C utility (hemolysis, blood transfusion) have not occurred. The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital has often been considered secondary in importance to the condition that prompted admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B457">457</xref>). However, a body of literature now supports targeted glucose control in the hospital setting for potential improved clinical outcomes. Hyperglycemia in the hospital may result from stress, decompensation of type 1 or type 2 or other forms of diabetes, and/or may be iatrogenic due to withholding of antihyperglycemic medications or administration of hyperglycemia-provoking agents such as glucocorticoids or vasopressors.</p><p>There is substantial observational evidence linking hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients (with or without diabetes) to poor outcomes. Cohort studies as well as a few early RCTs suggested that intensive treatment of hyperglycemia improved hospital outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B457">457</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B459">459</xref>). In general, these studies were heterogeneous in terms of patient population, blood glucose targets and insulin protocols used, provision of nutritional support, and the proportion of patients receiving insulin, which limits the ability to make meaningful comparisons among them. Recent trials in critically ill patients have failed to show a significant improvement in mortality with intensive glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B460">460</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B461">461</xref>) or have even shown increased mortality risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B462">462</xref>). Moreover, these recent RCTs have highlighted the risk of severe hypoglycemia resulting from such efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B460">460</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B465">465</xref>).</p><p>The largest study to date, NICE-SUGAR (Normoglycaemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation), a multicenter, multinational RCT, compared the effect of intensive glycemic control (target 81&#x02013;108 mg/dL, mean blood glucose attained 115 mg/dL) to standard glycemic control (target 144&#x02013;180 mg/dL, mean blood glucose attained 144 mg/dL) on outcomes among 6,104 critically ill participants, almost all of whom required mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B462">462</xref>). Ninety-day mortality was significantly higher in the intensive versus the conventional group in both surgical and medical patients, as was mortality from cardiovascular causes. Severe hypoglycemia was also more common in the intensively treated group (6.8% vs. 0.5%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The precise reason for the increased mortality in the tightly controlled group is unknown. The results of this study lie in stark contrast to a famous 2001 single-center study that reported a 42% relative reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in critically ill surgical patients treated to a target blood glucose of 80&#x02013;110 mg/dL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B458">458</xref>). Importantly, the control group in NICE-SUGAR had reasonably good blood glucose management, maintained at a mean glucose of 144 mg/dL, only 29 mg/dL above the intensively managed patients. Accordingly, this study&#x02019;s findings do not disprove the notion that glycemic control in the ICU is important. However, they do strongly suggest that it may not be necessary to target blood glucose values &#x0003c;140 mg/dL and that a highly stringent target of &#x0003c;110 mg/dL may actually be dangerous.</p><p>In a recent meta-analysis of 26 trials (<italic>N</italic> = 13,567), which included the NICE-SUGAR data, the pooled RR of death with intensive insulin therapy was 0.93 as compared with conventional therapy (95% CI 0.83&#x02013;1.04) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B465">465</xref>). Approximately half of these trials reported hypoglycemia, with a pooled RR of intensive therapy of 6.0 (95% CI 4.5&#x02013;8.0). The specific ICU setting influenced the findings, with patients in surgical ICUs appearing to benefit from intensive insulin therapy (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44&#x02013;0.91), whereas those in other medical and mixed critical care settings did not. It was concluded that, overall, intensive insulin therapy increased the risk of hypoglycemia but provided no overall benefit on mortality in the critically ill, although a possible mortality benefit to patients admitted to the surgical ICU was suggested.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s170"><title>1. Glycemic targets in hospitalized patients</title><sec id="s171"><title>Definition of glucose abnormalities in the hospital setting</title><p>Hyperglycemia in the hospital has been defined as any blood glucose &#x0003e;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this may require treatment in hospitalized patients. A1C values &#x0003e;6.5% suggest, in undiagnosed patients, that diabetes preceded hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B466">466</xref>). Hypoglycemia has been defined as any blood glucose &#x0003c;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counter-regulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many as &#x0003c;40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L), although this is lower than the &#x0223c;50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B467">467</xref>). As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40&#x02013;69 mg/dL [2.2&#x02013;3.8 mmol/L]) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s172"><title>Critically ill patients</title><p>Based on the weight of the available evidence, for the majority of critically ill patients in the ICU setting, insulin infusion should be used to control hyperglycemia, with a starting threshold of no higher than 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). Once intravenous insulin is started, the glucose level should be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dL (7.8 and 10.0 mmol/L). Greater benefit maybe realized at the lower end of this range. Although strong evidence is lacking, somewhat lower glucose targets may be appropriate in selected patients. One small study suggested that medical intensive care unit (MICU) patients treated to targets of 120&#x02013;140 mg/dL had less negative nitrogen balance than those treated to higher targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B469">469</xref>). However, targets &#x0003c;110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) are not recommended. Use of insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, resulting in low rates of hypoglycemia, are highly recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s173"><title>Non&#x02013;critically ill patients</title><p>With no prospective RCT data to inform specific glycemic targets in non&#x02013;critically ill patients, recommendations are based on clinical experience and judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B470">470</xref>). For the majority of non&#x02013;critically ill patients treated with insulin, premeal glucose targets should generally be &#x0003c;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) with random blood glucose &#x0003c;180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L), as long as these targets can be safely achieved. To avoid hypoglycemia, consideration should be given to reassessing the insulin regimen if blood glucose levels fall below 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). Modification of the regimen is required when blood glucose values are &#x0003c;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), unless the event is easily explained by other factors (such as a missed meal). There is some evidence that systematic attention to hyperglycemia in the emergency room leads to better glycemic control in the hospital for those subsequently admitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B471">471</xref>).</p><p>Occasional patients with a prior history of successful tight glycemic control in the outpatient setting who are clinically stable may be maintained with a glucose range below the above cut points. Conversely, higher glucose ranges may be acceptable in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities, as well as in those in patient care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible.</p><p>Clinical judgment, combined with ongoing assessment of the patient&#x02019;s clinical status, including changes in the trajectory of glucose measures, the severity of illness, nutritional status, or concurrent use of medications that might affect glucose levels (e.g., steroids, octreotide), must be incorporated into the day-to-day decisions regarding insulin dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s174"><title>2. Antihyperglycemic agents in hospitalized patients</title><p>In the hospital setting, insulin therapy is the preferred method of glycemic control in majority of clinical situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>). In the ICU, intravenous infusion is the preferred route of insulin administration. When the patient is transitioned off intravenous insulin to subcutaneous therapy, precautions should be taken to prevent hyperglycemia escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B472">472</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B473">473</xref>). Outside of critical care units, scheduled subcutaneous insulin that delivers basal, nutritional, and correction (supplemental) components is preferred. Typical dosing schemes are based on body weight, with some evidence that patients with renal insufficiency should be treated with lower doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B474">474</xref>). Prolonged therapy with sliding-scale insulin (SSI) as the sole regimen is ineffective in the majority of patients, increases risk of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and has recently been shown in a randomized trial to be associated with adverse outcomes in general surgery patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B475">475</xref>). SSI is potentially dangerous in type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>). The reader is referred to several recent publications and reviews that describe currently available insulin preparations and protocols and provide guidance in use of insulin therapy in specific clinical settings including parenteral nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B476">476</xref>), enteral tube feedings and with high dose glucocorticoid therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>).</p><p>There are no data on the safety and efficacy of oral agents and injectable noninsulin therapies such as GLP-1 analogs and pramlintide in the hospital. They are generally considered to have a limited role in the management of hyperglycemia in conjunction with acute illness. Continuation of these agents may be appropriate in selected stable patients who are expected to consume meals at regular intervals, and they may be initiated or resumed in anticipation of discharge once the patient is clinically stable. Specific caution is required with metformin, due to the possibility that a contraindication may develop during the hospitalization, such as renal insufficiency, unstable hemodynamic status, or need for an imaging study that requires a radio-contrast dye.</p></sec><sec id="s175"><title>3. Preventing hypoglycemia</title><p>In the hospital, multiple risk factors for hypoglycemia are present. Patients with or without diabetes may experience hypoglycemia in the hospital in association with altered nutritional state, heart failure, renal or liver disease, malignancy, infection, or sepsis. Additional triggering events leading to iatrogenic hypoglycemia include sudden reduction of corticosteroid dose, altered ability of the patient to report symptoms, reduction of oral intake, emesis, new NPO status, inappropriate timing of short- or rapid-acting insulin in relation to meals, reduction of rate of administration of intravenous dextrose, and unexpected interruption of enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition.</p><p>Despite the preventable nature of many inpatient episodes of hypoglycemia, institutions are more likely to have nursing protocols for the treatment of hypoglycemia than for its prevention. Tracking such episodes and analyzing their causes are important quality-improvement activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s176"><title>4. Diabetes care providers in the hospital</title><p>Inpatient diabetes management may be effectively championed and/or provided by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, intensivists, or hospitalists. Involvement of appropriately trained specialists or specialty teams may reduce length of stay, improve glycemic control, and improve outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>). In the care of diabetes, implementation of standardized order sets for scheduled and correction-dose insulin may reduce reliance on sliding-scale management. As hospitals move to comply with &#x0201c;meaningful use&#x0201d; regulations for electronic health records, as mandated by the Health Information Technology Act, efforts should be made to assure that all components of structured insulin order sets are incorporated into electronic insulin order sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B477">477</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B478">478</xref>).</p><p>A team approach is needed to establish hospital pathways. To achieve glycemic targets associated with improved hospital outcomes, hospitals will need multidisciplinary support to develop insulin management protocols that effectively and safely enable achievement of glycemic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B479">479</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s177"><title>5. Self-management in the hospital</title><p>Self-management of diabetes in the hospital may be appropriate for competent adult patients who have a stable level of consciousness, have reasonably stable daily insulin requirements, successfully conduct self-management of diabetes at home, have physical skills needed to successfully self-administer insulin and perform SMBG, have adequate oral intake, and are proficient in carbohydrate counting, use of multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy, and sick-day management. The patient and physician, in consultation with nursing staff, must agree that patient self-management is appropriate under the conditions of hospitalization.</p><p>Patients who use CSII pump therapy in the outpatient setting can be candidates for diabetes self-management in the hospital, provided that they have the mental and physical capacity to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B468">468</xref>). A hospital policy and procedures delineating inpatient guidelines for CSII therapy are advisable, and availability of hospital personnel with expertise in CSII therapy is essential. It is important that nursing personnel document basal rates and bolus doses taken on a regular basis (at least daily).</p></sec><sec id="s178"><title>6. MNT in the hospital</title><p>The goals of MNT are to optimize glycemic control, to provide adequate calories to meet metabolic demands, and to create a discharge plan for follow-up care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B457">457</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B480">480</xref>). The ADA does not endorse any single meal plan or specified percentages of macronutrients, and the term &#x0201c;ADA diet&#x0201d; should no longer be used. Current nutrition recommendations advise individualization based on treatment goals, physiological parameters, and medication usage. Consistent carbohydrate meal plans are preferred by many hospitals because they facilitate matching the prandial insulin dose to the amount of carbohydrate consumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B481">481</xref>). Because of the complexity of nutrition issues in the hospital, a registered dietitian, knowledgeable and skilled in MNT, should serve as an inpatient team member. The dietitian is responsible for integrating information about the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition, eating, and lifestyle habits and for establishing treatment goals in order to determine a realistic plan for nutrition therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B482">482</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B483">483</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s179"><title>7. Bedside blood glucose monitoring</title><p>POC blood glucose monitoring performed at the bedside is used to guide insulin dosing. In the patient who is receiving nutrition, the timing of glucose monitoring should match carbohydrate exposure. In the patient who is not receiving nutrition, glucose monitoring is performed every 4 to 6 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B484">484</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B485">485</xref>). More frequent blood glucose testing ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h is required for patients on intravenous insulin infusions.</p><p>Safety standards should be established for blood glucose monitoring prohibiting sharing of finger-stick lancing devices, lancets, needles, and meters to reduce the risk of transmission of blood borne diseases.

Although the FDA allows a +/&#x02212; 20% error for blood glucose meters, questions about the appropriateness of these criteria have been raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B388">388</xref>). Glucose measures differ significantly between plasma and whole blood, terms that are often used interchangeably and can lead to misinterpretation. Most commercially available capillary blood glucose meters introduce a correction factor of &#x0223c;1.12 to report a &#x0201c;plasma-adjusted&#x0201d; value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B487">487</xref>).</p><p>Significant discrepancies between capillary, venous, and arterial plasma samples have been observed in patients with low or high hemoglobin concentrations, hypoperfusion, and the presence of interfering substances particularly maltose, as contained in immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B488">488</xref>). Analytical variability has been described with several POC meters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B489">489</xref>). Increasingly newer generation POC blood glucose meters correct for variation in hematocrit and for interfering substances. Any glucose result that does not correlate with the patient&#x02019;s status should be confirmed through conventional laboratory sampling of plasma glucose. The FDA has become increasingly concerned about the use of POC blood glucose meters in the hospital and is presently reviewing matters related to their use.</p></sec><sec id="s180"><title>8. Discharge planning and DSME</title><p>Transition from the acute care setting is a high-risk time for all patients, not just those with diabetes or new hyperglycemia. Although there is an extensive literature concerning safe transition within and from the hospital, little of it is specific to diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B490">490</xref>). It is important to remember that diabetes discharge planning is not a separate entity, but is part of an overall discharge plan. As such, discharge planning begins at admission to the hospital and is updated as projected patient needs change.</p><p>Inpatients may be discharged to varied settings, including home (with or without visiting nurse services), assisted living, rehabilitation, or skilled nursing facilities. The latter two sites are generally staffed by health professionals, so diabetes discharge planning will be limited to communication of medication and diet orders. For the patient who is discharged to assisted living or to home, the optimal program will need to consider the type and severity of diabetes, the effects of the patient&#x02019;s illness on blood glucose levels, and the capacities and desires of the patient. Smooth transition to outpatient care should be ensured. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) recommends that at a minimum, discharge plans include the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Medication reconciliation:</bold> The patient&#x02019;s medications must be cross-checked to ensure that no chronic medications were stopped and to ensure the safety of new prescriptions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Whenever possible, prescriptions for new or changed medication should be filled and reviewed with the patient and family at or before discharge.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Structured discharge communication:</bold> Information on medication changes, pending tests and studies, and follow-up needs must be accurately and promptly communicated to outpatient physicians.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Discharge summaries should be transmitted to the primary physician as soon as possible after discharge.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Appointment keeping behavior is enhanced when the inpatient team schedules outpatient medical follow-up prior to discharge.

Patients are ill, under increased stress related to their hospitalization and diagnosis, and in an environment not conducive to learning. Ideally, people with diabetes should be taught at a time and place conducive to learning: as an outpatient in a recognized program of diabetes education. For the hospitalized patient, diabetes &#x0201c;survival skills&#x0201d; education is generally a feasible approach to provide sufficient information and training to enable safe care at home. Patients hospitalized because of a crisis related to diabetes management or poor care at home need education to prevent subsequent episodes of hospitalization. An assessment of the need for a home health referral or referral to an outpatient diabetes education program should be part of discharge planning for all patients.</p><p>DSME cannot wait until discharge, especially in those new to insulin therapy or in whom the diabetes regimen has been substantially altered during the hospitalization.</p><p>It is recommended that the following areas of knowledge be reviewed and addressed prior to hospital discharge:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Identification of health care provider who will provide diabetes care after discharge</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level of understanding related to the diagnosis of diabetes, SMBG, and explanation of home blood glucose goals</p></list-item><list-item><p>Definition, recognition, treatment, and prevention of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information on consistent eating patterns</p></list-item><list-item><p>When and how to take blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medications including insulin administration (if going home on insulin)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sick-day management</p></list-item><list-item><p>Proper use and disposal of needles and syringes</p></list-item></list></p><p>It is important that patients be provided with appropriate durable medical equipment, medication, supplies, and prescriptions at the time of discharge in order to avoid a potentially dangerous hiatus in care. These supplies/prescriptions should include the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Insulin (vials or pens) if needed</p></list-item><list-item><p>Syringes or pen needles (if needed)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Oral medications (if needed)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Blood glucose meter and strips</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lancets and lancing device</p></list-item><list-item><p>Urine ketone strips (type 1)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Glucagon emergency kit (insulin-treated)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Medical alert application/charm</p></list-item></list></p><p>More expanded diabetes education can be arranged in the community. An outpatient follow-up visit with the primary care provider, endocrinologist, or diabetes educator within 1 month of discharge is advised for all patients having hyperglycemia in the hospital. Clear communication with outpatient providers either directly or via hospital discharge summaries facilitates safe transitions to outpatient care. Providing information regarding the cause or the plan for determining the cause of hyperglycemia, related complications and comorbidities, and recommended treatments can assist outpatient providers as they assume ongoing care.</p></sec><sec id="s181"><title>B. Diabetes and employment</title><p>Any person with diabetes, whether insulin treated or noninsulin treated, should be eligible for any employment for which he/she is otherwise qualified. Employment decisions should never be based on generalizations or stereotypes regarding the effects of diabetes. When questions arise about the medical fitness of a person with diabetes for a particular job, a health care professional with expertise in treating diabetes should perform an individualized assessment. See the ADA position statement on diabetes and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B492">492</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s182"><title>C. Diabetes and driving</title><p>A large percentage of people with diabetes in the U.S. and elsewhere seek a license to drive, either for personal or employment purposes. There has been considerable debate whether, and the extent to which, diabetes may be a relevant factor in determining the driver ability and eligibility for a license.</p><p>People with diabetes are subject to a great variety of licensing requirements applied by both state and federal jurisdictions, which may lead to loss of employment or significant restrictions on a person&#x02019;s license. Presence of a medical condition that can lead to significantly impaired consciousness or cognition may lead to drivers being evaluated for fitness to drive. For diabetes, this typically arises when the person has had a hypoglycemic episode behind the wheel, even if this did not lead to a motor vehicle accident.</p><p>Epidemiological and simulator data suggest that people with insulin-treated diabetes have a small increase in risk of motor vehicle accidents, primarily due to hypoglycemia and decreased awareness of hypoglycemia. This increase (RR 1.12&#x02013;1.19) is much smaller than the risks associated with teenage male drivers (RR 42), driving at night (RR 142), driving on rural roads compared with urban roads (RR 9.2), and obstructive sleep apnea (RR 2.4), all of which are accepted for unrestricted licensure.</p><p>The ADA position statement on diabetes and driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B493">493</xref>) recommends against blanket restrictions based on the diagnosis of diabetes and urges individual assessment by a health care professional knowledgeable in diabetes if restrictions on licensure are being considered. Patients should be evaluated for decreased awareness of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia episodes while driving, or severe hypoglycemia. Patients with retinopathy or peripheral neuropathy require assessment to determine if those complications interfere with operation of a motor vehicle. Health care professionals should be cognizant of the potential risk of driving with diabetes and counsel their patients about detecting and avoiding hypoglycemia while driving.</p></sec><sec id="s183"><title>D. Diabetes management in correctional institutions</title><p>People with diabetes in correctional facilities should receive care that meets national standards. Because it is estimated that nearly 80,000 inmates have diabetes, correctional institutions should have written policies and procedures for the management of diabetes and for training of medical and correctional staff in diabetes care practices. See the ADA position statement on diabetes management in correctional institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B494">494</xref>) for further discussion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s184"><title>X.

(B)</p></list-item></list><p>There has been steady improvement in the proportion of diabetic patients achieving recommended levels of A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol in the last 10 years, both in primary care settings and in endocrinology practices. Mean A1C nationally has declined from 7.82% in 1999&#x02013;2000 to 7.18% in 2004 based on NHANES data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B495">495</xref>). This has been accompanied by improvements in lipids and blood pressure control and led to substantial reductions in end-stage microvascular complications in those with diabetes. Nevertheless in some studies only 57.1% of adults with diagnosed diabetes achieved an A1C of &#x0003c;7%, only 45.5% had a blood pressure &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg, and just 46.5% had a total cholesterol &#x0003c;200 mg/dL, with only 12.2% of people with diabetes achieving all three treatment goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B496">496</xref>). Evidence also suggests that progress in risk factor control may be slowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B497">497</xref>). Certain patient groups, such as patients with complex comorbidities, financial or other social hardships, and/or limited English proficiency, may present particular challenges to goal-based care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B498">498</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B499">499</xref>). Persistent variation in quality of diabetes care across providers and across practice settings even after adjusting for patient factors indicates that there remains potential for substantial further improvements in diabetes care.</p><p>Although numerous interventions to improve adherence to the recommended standards have been implemented, a major barrier to optimal care is a delivery system that too often is fragmented, lacks clinical information capabilities, often duplicates services, and is poorly designed for the coordinated delivery of chronic care. The CCM has been shown in numerous studies to be an effective framework for improving the quality of diabetes care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B500">500</xref>). The CCM includes six core elements for the provision of optimal care of patients with chronic disease: <italic>1</italic>) delivery system design (moving from a <italic>reactive</italic> to a <italic>proactive care</italic> delivery system where planned visits are coordinated through a team based approach), <italic>2</italic>) self-management support, <italic>3</italic>) decision support (basing care on evidence-based, effective care guidelines), <italic>4</italic>) clinical information systems (using registries that can provide patient-specific and population-based support to the care team), <italic>5</italic>) community resources and policies (identifying or developing resources to support healthy lifestyles), and <italic>6</italic>) health systems (to create a quality-oriented culture). Redefinition of the roles of the clinic staff and promoting self-management on the part of the patient are fundamental to the successful implementation of the CCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B501">501</xref>). Collaborative, multidisciplinary teams are best suited to provide such care for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and to facilitate patients&#x02019; performance of appropriate self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163">163</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B165">165</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B220">220</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B502">502</xref>).</p><p>NDEP maintains an online resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.betterdiabetescare.nih.gov">www.betterdiabetescare.nih.gov</ext-link>) to help health care professionals design and implement more effective health care delivery systems for those with diabetes. Three specific objectives, with references to literature that outlines practical strategies to achieve each, are outlined below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s187"><title>Objective 1: Optimize provider and team behavior</title><p>The care team should prioritize timely and appropriate intensification of lifestyle and/or pharmaceutical therapy of patients who have not achieved beneficial levels of blood pressure, lipid, or glucose control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B503">503</xref>). Strategies such as explicit goal setting with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B504">504</xref>); identifying and addressing language, numeracy, or cultural barriers to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B505">505</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B508">508</xref>); integrating evidence-based guidelines and clinical information tools into the process of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B509">509</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B511">511</xref>); and incorporating care management teams including nurses, pharmacists, and other providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B512">512</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B515">515</xref>) have each been shown to optimize provider and team behavior and thereby catalyze reduction in A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="s188"><title>Objective 2: Support patient behavior change</title><p>Successful diabetes care requires a systematic approach to supporting patients&#x02019; behavior change efforts, including <italic>a</italic>) healthy lifestyle changes (physical activity, healthy eating, nonuse of tobacco, weight management, effective coping), <italic>b</italic>) disease self-management (medication taking and management; self-monitoring of glucose and blood pressure when clinically appropriate), and <italic>c</italic>) prevention of diabetes complications (self-monitoring of foot health; active participation in screening for eye, foot, and renal complications; immunizations). High-quality DSME has been shown to improve patient self-management, satisfaction, and glucose control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B184">184</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B516">516</xref>), as has delivery of ongoing DSMS so that gains achieved during DSME are sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">134</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">135</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152">152</xref>). National DSME standards call for an integrated approach that includes clinical content and skills, behavioral strategies (goal-setting, problem solving), and addressing emotional concerns in each needed curriculum content area.</p></sec><sec id="s189"><title>Objective 3: Change the system of care</title><p>The most successful practices have an institutional priority for providing high quality of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B517">517</xref>). Changes that have been shown to increase quality of diabetes care include basing care on evidence-based guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B518">518</xref>), expanding the role of teams and staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B501">501</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B519">519</xref>), redesigning the processes of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B520">520</xref>), implementing electronic health record tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B521">521</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B522">522</xref>), activating and educating patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B523">523</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B524">524</xref>), and identifying and/or developing and engaging community resources and public policy that support healthy lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B525">525</xref>). Recent initiatives such as the Patient-Centered Medical Home show promise to improve outcomes through coordinated primary care and offer new opportunities for team-based chronic disease care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B526">526</xref>). Alterations in reimbursement that reward the provision of appropriate and high-quality care rather than visit-based billing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B527">527</xref>) and that can accommodate the need to personalize care goals may provide additional incentives to improve diabetes care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B528">528</xref>).</p><p>It is clear that optimal diabetes management requires an organized, systematic approach and involvement of a coordinated team of dedicated health care professionals working in an environment where patient-centered high-quality care is a priority.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">American Diabetes Association. <italic>Medical Management of Type 1 Diabetes</italic>.
