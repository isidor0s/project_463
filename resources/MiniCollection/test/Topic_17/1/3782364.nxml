The main clinical manifestations are severe recurrent infections that often lead to structural damage of affected organs. The early start of adequate intravenous immunoglobulin therapy has significantly improved the prognosis of this serious disorder. Patients with CVID are also predisposed to autoimmune and lymphoproliferative complications. This article deals with the features of this primary immunodeficiency in adults. Clinical manifestations, immunological features and treatment concepts were gathered during 21 years of observation of such patients in Moscow.

The medical history was collected from all patients (emphasis being on the manifestation of first symptoms, mainly affected organs and systems), as was family history, the dynamics of clinical symptoms and, the effectiveness of the therapy. All patients were physically examined, and blood and urine tests were also conducted. We also used X-rays and computed tomography of the chest and sinuses, esophagogastroscopy, colonoscopy (indication), ultrasonography of the abdomen, kidneys and, thymus, research conducted on electrocardiogram (ECG) and, respiratory function. Patients were examined by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, gastroenterologist, pulmonologist, hematologist and, a rheumatologist.</p><p>Immunological testing included the study of the following parameters of the immune system: the total number of leukocytes and lymphocytes, the percentage and absolute number of T-lymphocytes (CD3<sup>+</sup>-cells) and subpopulations of T-lymphocytes (CD4<sup>+</sup>-cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>-cells), natural killer (NK)-cells (CD16<sup>+</sup>-cells) and, B-lymphocytes (CD19<sup>+</sup>-cells) in peripheral blood. Levels of immunoglobulin classes A, M, G and, E in serum were determined by nephelometry. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes was measured by cytometry using monoclonal antibodies. Autoantibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. For detection of red-cell antibodies we used Coombs' reaction. The phagocytic link of immunity was investigated by determining the absolute and percentage content of neutrophils and monocytes, the absorptive activity of leukocytes, phagocyte chemiluminescence and bactericidal activity of leukocytes.</p><p>Assessment of treatment efficiency was carried out by analyzing the dynamics of clinical and immunological parameters, measuring the duration of remission of the underlying disease and, studying the patient's of quality of life. Monitoring of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) was carried out before the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to evaluate the achievement of adequate levels of IgG (not less than 5.0 g/l).</p><p>Analysis of the incidence of infectious complications and receiving antibiotics was carried out using the questionnaire "Total well-being: the emergence of infectious complications" filled prior to the IVIG infusion and, on the 2nd and 10th day after the transfusion medicine.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Questionnaire: total well-being - the emergence of infectious complications</title><p>Questionnaire used to analyze the incidence of infectious complications and antibiotic administration related to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG).</p></caption><media xlink:href="f1000research-1-215-s0001.tgz"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><p>Assessment of the safety of IVIG was performed on the basis of data on tolerability, and analysis of the patient&#x02019;s vital signs and markers of renal function.

These symptoms characterize a reaction to the introduction of a large dose of protein, which is not an indication to stop administering the drug. Since IVIG is vital, individual selection of drugs was conducted, if necessary, patients received premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines or inhibitors of prostaglandins, which were pre-introduced (20&#x02013;30 minutes prior to transfusion of IVIG) to avoid possible adverse reactions.</p><p>Replacement therapy in most cases is insufficient to control the foci of chronic infection, so in parallel with the introduction of IVIG, 40 (82%) of patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Due to this treatment the frequency of exacerbations of chronic foci of infection was significantly reduced. Four patients received acyclovir permanently because of the continuous recurrence of herpes infection. Immunosuppressive therapy was conducted in 7 patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia and anemia. Hematopoietic growth factors were used in 5 patients with neutropenia, and 2 patients received ongoing treatment with growth factors. Due to the complex treatment, exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media and, herpes occured less often and less severely.

identified 57 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) over 21 years. This must represent only a fraction of the total number for such a large metropolitan area over such a long period of time. I suspect that many patients have gone undiagnosed and this leads me to question the general applicability of some of the authors&#x02019; findings.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors do not include their case definition of CVID. There are many immunodeficiencies associated with hypogammaglobulinemia that would not be classified as CVID. The authors state that they studied quality of life in these patients, but they do not report any of that data here. The humoral and cellular immunologic data should be presented in a table with mean, standard deviation, median and range together with the authors&#x02019; normal ranges. The authors speak very generally about a variety of therapeutic measures applied in addition to IgG but doesn&#x02019;t provide any quantitative (or often even qualitative) report of the response (or not) to these therapies. The mortality in these patents seems high. How does it compare with published assessment of mortality in CVID? Finally, the authors do not provide any evidence to support their conclusion that &#x0201c;The developed approach and education of GPs has improved the diagnostics of predominantly antibody deficiencies in adults in Moscow&#x0201d;.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to state that I do not consider it to be of an acceptable scientific standard, for reasons outlined above.</p></body><sub-article id="comment77" article-type="response"><front-stub><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Karaulov</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><aff>I.M.

The article reflects the work done during 20 years to improve the diagnosis of CVID and introduction of IVIG in Moscow.</p><p>The diagnosis of CVID was verified on the basis of the typical clinical presentations and immunological deviations. CVID was diagnosed according to the criteria of this form of PID developed by ESID and PAGID. Other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia were excluded in these patients. For example, genetic typing was conducted to exclude X-linked agammaglobulinemia.</p><p>The article focuses on the clinical manifestations of CVID, their characteristics, variety, the defeat of many organs and systems. The purpose of this scientific article is to draw attention of GPs to the problem of CVID. Due to awareness of the early clinical signs of CVID, GPs send patients to an immunologist. Thereby, a delay in diagnosis of CVID decreases. During past 10 years a delay in diagnosis of CVID in Moscow decreased from 14.5 to 6.4 years; due to early start of IVIG therapy quality of life has increased significantly &#x02013; no operations on organs of respiratory tract in recent years.</p><p>At the beginning of the formation of Moscow registry of adult patients with CVID there were only 4 alive patients over 18 years. Over the years of observation a number of adult patients has increased by more than 10 times. This is due to improvement of diagnosis of CVID and increase GPs, knowledge.</p><p>More detailed characteristics of immunologic abnormalities in patients with CVID, the assessment of quality of life, more detailed description of the treatment strategy and the effectiveness of drugs will be presented in the following publications.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article><sub-article id="report374" article-type="peer-review"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>Referee response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grumach</surname><given-names>Anete</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="r374a1">1</xref><role>Referee</role></contrib><aff id="r374a1"><label>1</label>Departments of Pediatrics and Dermatology, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo Medical School, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil</aff></contrib-group><author-notes><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests: </bold>No competing interests were disclosed.</p></fn></author-notes><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>16</day><month>11</month><year>2012</year></pub-date><related-article id="d35e948" related-article-type="peer-reviewed-article" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.12688/f1000research.1-46.v1">Version 1</related-article><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>recommendation</meta-name><meta-value>approve</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript describes a Russian experience with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients.
