The most common forms of neuromuscular disorders are Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) of the myopathic disorders and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) of the neurogenic disorders. Despite differences in etiology both forms have a lot of characteristics in common. Both disorders have a genetic origin and have an effect on several systems, requiring a multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment. Typical for both of these disorders is the progressive character of the muscle weakness and as a result ventilatory restriction and a progressive scoliosis. Usually joint contractures, as well as nutritional disorders are present. In dystrophinopathy, cardiac dysfunction and mental retardation can occur as well.</p><p>Severe scoliosis causes discomfort and compromises respiratory function. Spinal surgery is considered the primary treatment option for correcting severe scoliosis in neuromuscular disorders. It can improve the cardio-pulmonary function, the sitting balance, appearance, and the quality of life. However, in this population surgery is considered a major intervention with high risk. Careful preoperative evaluation should not be restricted to the spinal deformity itself, but anesthetic management, pediatric cardio-pulmonary care, postoperative intensive care and rehabilitation should be emphasized. Several issues concerning the surgical intervention are still controversial. For instance, what is the best time point for surgery, and is surgery always needed? Due to these uncertainties, the VSCA, a cooperation of various institutions and patients' associations of patients on assisted ventilation, experienced some difficulties and inconsistencies in the management of scoliosis treatment in patients with DMD and SMA in the Netherlands. It was proposed that the management of scoliosis in neuromuscular disorders could benefit from clear guidelines and more uniformity in definitions, and terminology, amongst the various disciplines involved. The effectiveness and safety of scoliosis surgery in DMD patients was recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Due to the absence of randomized controlled clinical trials the authors recommended to refer to anecdotal evidence and expert opinions in order to guide decision making in scoliosis surgery. Hence, a multidisciplinary study group "guidelines scoliosis in neuromuscular disorders" started with the development of multidisciplinary guidelines based on the Dutch situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the Dutch guideline for the treatment of scoliosis in neuromuscular disorders is to present recommendations based on the evidence available in systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, supplemented by cohort studies, and expert opinions. These recommendations are directed at a wide range of professionals dealing with the management of patients with scoliosis as a result of neuromuscular disease. The guideline strives for a multidisciplinary consensus about terminology, diagnostics, indications for surgery, surgical treatment, follow-up and patient education. Hence, the guideline supports a multidisciplinary approach and encourages collaboration between the different disciplines involved.</p><sec><title>Target population</title><p>The guideline is directed at professionals concerned with the management of scoliosis in patients with a neuromuscular disorder, and the professional associations that are involved in the treatment or care for these patients. Indirectly, these guidelines may inform relatives, and people otherwise engaged in the care for patients with neuromuscular disorders, educational organizations, and the general public.</p></sec><sec><title>Guidelines working group</title><p>The guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary group of experts in the field of neuromuscular scoliosis management. All relevant specialties involved in diagnostics and treatment were represented. In addition, representatives from societies of interest participated in the working group in order to create a sound basis for the application of the guideline.</p><p>The working method employed consisted of: 1) identification of problems by the working group, 2) translation into specific questions, 3) search of scientific evidence by sub-groups in answer to the questions posed, 4) discussion of the evidence in the complete working group and 5) resolving the recommendations for best practice by the working group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Evidence</title><p>The guideline is based on evidence from the available scientific publications and expert opinions. The evidence was categorized according to its strength (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

However, the term appeared to be interpreted differently within the various disciplines. Hence, a more specific definition was proposed. In this guideline, a neuromuscular disorder is defined as a defective function of the peripheral nerve system, the neuromuscular junction, or muscles, causing muscle weakness in the patient. Disorders of the central nervous system, such as cerebral palsy or spina bifida, are not included in this definition. Within this definition, neuromuscular disorders are the result of defective anterior horn cell function in the spinal cord (e.g. SMA), defects of the peripheral nerves (neuropathies), the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia gravis), structural defects of the muscle cells (myopathies), muscle cell degradation (muscular dystrophies), or metabolic myopathies (glycogenosis, mitochondrial myopathy). Most of these disorders are rare. Therefore, the relatively frequent occurring progressive disorders DMD and SMA, both associated with a high incidence of scoliosis, were taken as paradigm for the treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</title><p>DMD is an X-linked (Xp21) recessive inherited disease. Affected males inherited the genetic mutation from the mother, or developed the condition by spontaneous mutations in the gene. Usually, the affected boy has a slightly delayed motor development during infancy. Hereafter, symptoms are a rapidly progressive muscle weakness associated with muscle wasting associated with a progressive difficulty to walk. Most boys are wheelchair-bound at the age of 10. Major changes during puberty are the progressive muscle weakness in hands, arms, and torso, associated with the development of scoliosis. In this phase, the respiratory function is gradually deteriorating, with need of respiratory assistance, and a possible cardiomyopathy may induce problems. Mild mental retardation is present in approximately 40% of DMD patients.</p><p>DMD is diagnosed by repeated determination of extremely elevated Creatine Kinase (CPK-MM) levels in the bloodstream and mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X-chromosome, or by the absence of the gene product dystrophin in a muscle biopsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)</title><p>SMA includes a number of genetic disorders, all presenting with a manifestation of weakness due to loss of the motor neurons of the spinal cord and brainstem. The most common form of SMA is caused by a mutation of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) gene, located on chromosome 5q13. It is an autosomal recessive form which manifests over a wide range of severity affecting infants through adults. The spectrum has been classified into four types based on the onset of the symptoms and the level of weakness.</p><p><italic>SMA type 1</italic>, also known as severe infantile SMA or Werdnig Hoffmann disease, is the most severe, and manifests in the first year of life with the inability to ever maintain an independent sitting position. Children with SMA type 1 deteriorate rapidly and have a life expectancy of less than two years.</p><p><italic>SMA type 2</italic>, or intermediate SMA, describes those children who are wheelchair-bound very early in life. Usually, they are never able to walk and a severe dystrophy associated with considerable scoliosis develops already around the age of four. Some of the children depend on respiratory assistance during the night, and later around the clock, with or without tracheostomy. The onset of weakness is usually recognized some time between 6 and 18 months. Within the first three years SMA types 1 and 2 cannot be distinguished based on determination of the genetic lesion. Consequently, this is a very uncertain period for the parents.</p><p><italic>SMA type 3</italic>, also called juvenile SMA or Kugelberg-Welander disease has a more moderate course. Patients with SMA type 3 preserve their ability to walk until the second or third decade, and they develop less scoliosis and respiratory problems.</p><p>In <italic>SMA type 4</italic>, or adult SMA weakness usually begins in the third decade. The course of disease is much slower and has little or no impact on life expectancy.</p><p>This guideline is directed at the group of patients with SMA type 2.</p><p>SMA is diagnosed by the typical clinical symptoms and by the SMN gene test.</p></sec><sec><title>Spinal deformation</title><p>Scoliosis is a complex deformation that involves abnormal lateral and rotational curvature of the spine. Both in DMD and SMA type 2 scoliotic deformations are frequent. The deformation is mostly a progressive thoracolumbar C-curve with development of pelvic obliquity. Either an increased kyphosis or thoracic lordosis can be part of the deformity. The consequences of the deformity are loss of sitting balance, shortening of the trunk, and compression of the hart and lungs. The mobility of the ribs is reduced by rotation and deformation of the trunk, causing obstruction of the breathing capacity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Epidemiology &#x02013; incidence and prevalence of scoliosis</title><p>Epidemiologic data regarding scoliosis in DMD are provided by a few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, most studies are dated before the availability of DNA diagnostics. Possibly, Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) is included in some of these study groups. This may be associated with a lower incidence of scoliosis reported in the earlier studies. Development of scoliosis in DMD patients is strongly related to the loss of walking ability. Generally, ambulatory patients do not develop a scoliosis. However, as the patient's walking ability deteriorates and patients become wheelchair dependent, scoliosis starts to develop, mostly in the thoracolumbar region. Neither severity nor rate of progression can be predicted from the age at which spinal collapse occurs or the age at which ambulatory ability is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The incidence of spinal deformity in DMD varies between reports. No uniform method is used to describe the development of scoliosis. Oda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] define three types of spinal deformity, where type 3 is the type with the least deformity; a Cobb angle &#x0003c; 30&#x000b0;. They report that 15% (7/46) of patients who lost their walking ability belong to this group. Brooke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported that 75% of 120 patients developed a curve between 30&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0;. In an early study of 60 DMD patients the incidence of scoliosis, defined as a curve between 5&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0;, was 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In a more recent study 76% of untreated patients (24) and 17% of patients treated with corticosteroids (30) developed a scoliosis with a curve &#x0003e; 20&#x000b0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>All children with SMA type 2 develop scoliosis starting from an early age of around 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. At ten years of age the average curve is more than 54&#x000b0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In 80% of the cases the scoliosis is a low thoracic curve. The single curve is most prevalent (83%), however 17% of the patients develop a double curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><sec><title>Natural course of scoliosis</title><p>Data about the natural history of curve progression and the relationship between scoliosis, morbidity, and mortality are lacking. Although relationships have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] such relationships have not been substantiated by data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>1. Conservative phase</title><sec><title>Factors affecting the progression of scoliosis in DMD</title><sec><title>Evidence</title><p>Indications exist that not all patients with DMD develop a scoliosis. The natural course of scoliosis in DMD patients was studied by Oda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Oda et al. conclude that there is no indication for surgery when the Cobb's angle is less than 30&#x000b0; in 15 year old patients. This is the case in 15% of the described patient group. Yamashita et al. argue that in order to determine early which DMD patients need surgical intervention for treatment of spinal deformity, criteria should be developed to predict the progression of the deformity in the individual patient at an earlier age than 14 or 15 years. To predict which patients at the age of 10 are likely to develop a severe scoliosis they studied a group of 12 patients retrospectively and performed multiple discriminant analysis. The vital capacity (VC), and Cobb angle of spinal scoliosis at the age of 10 years, the age at which ambulation ceased, and the curve pattern of spinal scoliosis were found to be predictors for the progression of scoliosis. They propose a model based on these predictors to guide the judgment whether surgical stabilization of the spine should be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion/conclusion</title><p>In the absence of DNA verification it is unsure if all patients in the studies of Oda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] are DMD patients. Possibly, patients with BMD were included as well. Hence, the percentage of DMD patients that do not develop a scoliosis remains uncertain. Nevertheless, it is plausible that surgery to correct spinal scoliosis is not indicated in all DMD patients <italic>(level 2) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The criteria suggested by Yamashita et al. predicting the progression of scoliosis may still be relevant and could be applied to patients with a diagnosis of DMD. The decline in pulmonary function is presumably correlated with the progression of scoliosis <italic>(level 2) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The decline in vital capacity is, however, expected to occur as part of the natural history of the condition in patients with DMD and/or SMA and this is not necessarily causally related to the development of scoliosis. It is imperative that the diagnosis of DMD is confirmed by DNA analysis. This may help to uncover which proportion of established DMD patients does not develop a progressive scoliosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>&#x025aa; It is important to find out whether a child with DMD belongs to the small minority that does not develop a severe scoliosis. For this purpose, the respiratory function should be monitored in children with DMD, since the vital capacity is a possible indicator of the progression of scoliosis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Factors affecting the progression of scoliosis in SMA type 2</title><sec><title>Evidence</title><p>Progressive spinal deformity occurs in all children with SMA type 2 (workgroup opinion (WO)).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion/conclusion</title><p>The incidence of scoliosis in SMA type 2 is 100%. Hence, all children with SMA type 2 are at some time indicated for surgical intervention <italic>(level 4)</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>&#x025aa; All children with SMA type 2 should be operated to correct the spinal deformity at some time point.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conservative treatment of scoliosis in DMD</title><sec><title>Evidence</title><p>Brace treatment and sitting orthoses cannot prevent the development or progression of scoliosis in DMD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some findings suggest that prolongation of walking by the use of orthoses can prevent a rapid progression of scoliosis in DMD patients between 13 and 15 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, Bakker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] concluded in a review of 35 studies that it is uncertain whether knee-ankle-foot orthoses can prolong functional walking, although it seems that the use of knee-ankle foot orthoses can prolong assisted walking and standing.</p><p>There is no evidence that physical training can influence the evolution of muscular dystrophies in the long term. If the patient rejects surgical intervention, orthotic treatment or seating adaptations build on the patients' wheelchair can be beneficial to improve the sitting comfort and to prevent decubitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion/conclusion</title><p>Findings in literature and experience from experts indicate that orthoses do not prevent the development or progression of scoliosis in DMD <italic>(level 3) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, orthoses should not be recommended for this purpose. Rodillo et al.

However, the complexity of multiple physical handicaps demands specific pre-operative and peri-operative care. In two Dutch hospitals information brochures were available. Parents and patients should be adequately informed about the pre-operative examinations, surgery, post-operative care, risks, and consequences of the surgery <italic>(level 4)</italic>.

Cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] states that special care should be taken to prevent infection of the airways. He reports that mobilization in a wheelchair takes place from day 2. This is in agreement with other literature. No evidence was found about aftercare.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion/conclusion</title><p>Patients are usually mobilized in a wheelchair from day 2&#x02013;5.

Rotation in the spine and hip flexion exceeding 90&#x000b0; are not allowed in this period. This has consequences for turning and lifting of the patients. A mobile hoist for the task of transferring a patient should be used. Before discharge the physical therapist should give instructions about lifting and sitting upright.</p><p>&#x02022; In consultation with the general practitioner temporary homecare may be arranged.</p><p>&#x02022; Measures should be taken to take care of changes in arm function due to the lengthening of the spine.</p><p>&#x02022; For the recovery period at home, homework assignments can be provided.</p><p>&#x02022; Because of the altered sitting position, the wheelchair needs to be adapted.

The ergotherapist supervises this.</p><p>&#x02022; The wheelchair should be adapted to optimize sitting comfort.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>&#x025aa; After deciding on scoliosis surgery, the orthopedic surgeon and rehabilitation specialist should anticipate possible post-operative (temporary) problems and alterations in required care.</p><p>&#x025aa; The (electric) wheelchair should be adapted in order to support a position in which sitting balance and head balance can be maintained with the least effort for the child.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Postoperative bracing</title><sec><title>Evidence</title><p>No comparative studies are available about post-operative bracing. Large variation exists in policies regarding the use of post-operative braces.

It is observed that sometimes a scoliotic deformation remains above the fusion trajectory. This should be taken into account when adaptations are made to the wheelchair.

The pediatrician, center for ventilation at home, and/or pulmonary specialist have to be consulted for screening of the pulmonary function. In DMD patients, the cardiologist has to be consulted for possible cardiomyopathy. Pre-operative screening must be performed as described above.</p><p>During surgery the anaesthesiologist considers all specific aspects of the neuromuscular disease (as described above). After surgery the patient is admitted at the intensive care unit. A threatening cardiomyopathy or respitory insufficiency requires monitoring at the pediatric intensive care. A physiotherapist coaches the child with respiratory techniques and coughing.</p><p>After surgery, the orthopedic surgeon has regular follow-ups and checks the sitting position in the wheelchair. The rehabilitation specialist verifies if adequate care is provided at home and coordinates adaptation of facilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>&#x025aa; Spine surgery in neuromuscular scoliosis requires a multidisciplinary team of specialist experienced with treatment of these patients. Close cooperation is needed all specialists involved, including physiotherapist and nursing staff.</p><p>&#x025aa; The use of a checklist for treatment and post-operative care of spine surgery in neuromuscular scoliosis is advised.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMD: Becker Muscular Dystrophy; DMD: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy; ECG: Echocardiography; PICU: Pediatric intensive care unit; RCT: Randomized controlled trials; SMA: Spinal Muscular Atrophy; SMN: Survival Motor Neuron; SSEP: Somatosensory evoked potential; TCE-MEP: Transcranial electrical motor evoked potential; VC: Vital capacity; VSCA: Dutch cooperation of various institutions and patients' associations of patients on assisted ventilation; WO: Workgroup opinion.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MGM wrote the manuscript together with BJVR, who was the chair of the working group.
